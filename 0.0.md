## JUDGMENT

䷁ represents what is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and having the firmness of a mare. When the superior man (here intended) has to make any movement, if he take the initiative, he will go astray; if he follow, he will find his (proper) lord. The advantageousness will be seen in his getting friends in the south-west, and losing friends in the north-east. If he rest in correctness and firmness, there will be good fortune.

> The same attributes are here ascribed to ䷁, as in the hexagram to ䷀; — but with a difference. The figure, made up of six divided lines, expresses the ideal of subordination and docility. The superior man, represented by it, must not take the initiative; and by following he will find his lord, — the subject, that is of ䷀. Again, the correctness and firmness is defined to be that of 'a mare,' 'docile and strong,' but a creature for the service of man. That it is not the sex of the animal which the writer has chiefly in mind is plain from the immediate mention of the superior man, and his lord.

> That superior man will seek to bring his friends along with himself to serve his ruler. But according to the arrangement of the trigrams, the place of ䷁ is in the south-west, while the opposite quarter is occupied by the trigram ☶. The subject of the hexagram to seek for others of the same principles and tendencies with himself to serve their common lord. But in quietness and firmness will be his strength.

### COMMENTS

1. Complete is the great and originating capacity indicated by ䷁! All things owe to it their birth; it receives obediently the influences of Heaven.
2. ䷁, in its largeness, supports and contains all things. Its excellent capacity matches the unlimited power (of ䷀). Its comprehension is wide, and its brightness great. The various things obtain by it their full development.
3. The mare is a creature of earthly kind. Its power of moving on the earth is without limit; it is mild and docile, advantageous and firm, such is the course of the superior man.
4. If he take the initiative, he goes astray; he misses, that is, his proper course. If he follow, he is docile, and gets into his regular course. In the south-west he will get friends, he will be walking with those of his own class. In the north-east he will lose friends, but in the end there will be ground for congratulation.
5. The good fortune arising from resting in firmness corresponds to the unlimited capacity of the earth.

> Hexagram ䷀ starts from the word 'heaven,' ䷁ attaches to 'earth.' The difference of ䷀ and ䷁ can be expressed by the words 'power' and 'capacity'. ䷀ originates; ䷁ produces, or gives birth to what has been originated.

> The penetrating, or developing ability of ䷁, as displayed in the processes of growth. The brightness refers to the beauty that shines forth in the vegetable and animal worlds.

> ䷁ treats of the symbol of the mare, to lead the mind to the course of the superior man, the good and faithful minister and servant.

> Resting in firmness is the normal course of ䷁. Where it is pursued, the good effect will be great, great as the unlimited capacity of the earth.

### EXPLANATION

1. What is indicated by ䷁ is most gentle and weak, but, when put in motion, is hard and strong; it is most still, but is able to give every definite form.
2. By following, it obtains its proper lord, and pursues its regular course.
3. It contains all things in itself, and its transforming power is glorious.
4. Yes, what docility marks the way of ䷁! It receives the influences of heaven, and acts at the proper time.

### SYMBOLISM

The capacity and sustaining power of the earth is what is denoted by ䷁. The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue supports men and things.

> ䷁ is formed by redoubling the trigram ☷ of the same name and having the earth for its symbol. As in the hexagram ䷀, the repetition is emphatic, not otherwise affecting the meaning of the hexagram. As there is but one heaven, so there is but one earth. ䷁ is the generative part of earth. By generative part it probably means the productive or prolific faculty. Generative part  is defined as the virility of males. Such is the special significance of it. If it were so used here, the earth would be masculine.

> The superior man, in his single person, sustains the burden of all under the sky. The common people depend on him for their rest and enjoyment. Birds and beasts and creeping things, and the tribes of the vegetable kingdom, depend on him for the fulfilment or their destined being. If he be of a narrow mind and cold virtue, how can he help them? Their hope in him would be in vain.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. In the first line, divided, we see its subject treading on hoarfrost. The strong ice will come by and by.

> He is treading on hoarfrost; the strong ice will come by and by; the cold air has begun to take form. Allow it to go on quietly according to its nature, and (the hoarfrost) will come to strong ice.

> The family that accumulates goodness is sure to have superabundant happiness, and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery. The murder of a ruler by his minister, or of his father by a son, is not the result of the events of one morning or one evening. The causes of it have gradually accumulated, through the absence of early discrimination. This line shows the natural issue and growth of things.

2. The second line, divided, shows the attribute of being straight, square, and great. Its operation, without repeated efforts, will be in every respect advantageous.

> The movement indicated by the second line, divided, is from the straight line to the square. Its operation, without repeated effort, in every way advantageous,' shows the brilliant result of the way of earth.

> This line presents to us the earth itself, as a great cube.

> Straight indicates the correctness of the internal principle, and square, the righteousness of the external act. The superior man, thus represented, by his self-reverence maintains the inward correctness, and in righteousness adjusts his external acts. His reverence and righteousness being thus established, his virtues are not solitary instances or of a single class. Straight, square, and great, working his operations, without repeated efforts, in every respect advantageous; this shows how such a one has no doubts as to what he does.

3. The third line, divided, shows its subject keeping his excellence under restraint, but firmly maintaining it. If he should have occasion to engage in the king's service, though he will not claim the success for himself, he will bring affairs to a good issue.

> He keeps his excellence under restraint, but firmly maintains it; at the proper time he will manifest it. He may have occasion to engage in the king's service; great is the glory of his wisdom.

> To keep his excellence under restraint, is the part of a minister or officer, seeking not his own glory, but that of his ruler.

> Although the subject of this divided line has excellent qualities, he (does not display them, but) keeps them under restraint. 'If he engage with them in the service of the king, and be successful, he will not claim that success for himself; this is the way of the earth, of a wife, of a minister. The way of the earth is not to claim the merit of achievement, but on behalf of heaven to bring things to their proper issue.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows the symbol of a sack tied up. There will be no ground for blame or for praise.

> A sack tied up; there will be no error; this shows how, through carefulness, no injury will be received.

> Through the changes and transformations produced by heaven and earth, plants and trees grow luxuriantly. If the reciprocal influence of heaven and earth were shut up and restrained, we should have a state that might suggest to us the case of men of virtue and ability lying in obscurity. A sack tied up; there will be no ground for blame or for praise, are in reality a lesson of caution.

> The fourth line shows its subject exercising a still greater restraint on himself than the third line.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows the yellow lower garment. There will be great good fortune.

> The Yellow lower-garment; there will be great good fortune; this follows from that ornamental colour's being in the right and central place.

> Yellow is one of the five correct colours, and the colour of the earth. The lower garment is a symbol of humility. The fifth line is the seat of honour. If its occupant possess the qualities indicated, he will be greatly fortunate.

> The superior man emblemed here by the yellow and correct colour, is possessed of comprehension and discrimination. He occupies the correct position of supremacy, but that emblem is on the lower part of his person. His excellence is in the centre of his being, but it diffuses a complacency over his four limbs, and is manifested in his conduct of affairs; this is the perfection of excellences.

6. The sixth line, divided shows dragons fighting in the wild. Their blood is purple and yellow.

> The dragons fight in the wild; the onward course (indicated by ☷) is pursued to extremity.

> What is there said to be beyond the proper limits takes place here in the wild. The humble subject of the divided line is transformed into a dragon, and fights with the true dragon, the subject of the undivided line. They fight and bleed, and their blood is of the colour proper to heaven or the sky, and the colour proper to the earth.

7. The lines of this hexagram are all weak and divided, as appears from the use of the number six. If those who are thus represented be perpetually correct and firm, advantage will arise.

> The lines are all weak and divided, as appears from the use of the number six; but those who are thus represented becoming perpetually correct and firm, there will thereby be a great consummation.

> The hexagram ䷁ should become changed into ䷀, the result of which would be good.

> The subject of the divided line thinking himself equal to the subject of the undivided line, there is sure to be a contest. As if indignant at there being no acknowledgment of the superiority of the subject of the undivided line, the text uses the term dragons. But still the subject of neither line can leave his class, and hence we have the blood mentioned. The mention of that as being both azure and yellow indicates the mixture of heaven and earth. Heaven's colour is azure and earth's is yellow.
