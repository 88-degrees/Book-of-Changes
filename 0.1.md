# ䷖ [Overthrowing] ☷∞☶

## 000.001

## JUDGMENT

䷖ indicates thatin the state which it symbolises it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever.

> ䷖  is the symbol of falling or of causing to fall, and may be applied, both in the natural and political world, to the process of decay, or that of overthrow. The figure consists of five divided lines, and one undivided, which last thus becomes the prominent and principal line in the figure. Decay or overthrow has begun at the bottom of it, and crept up to the top. The hexagram is that of the ninth month, when the beauty and glory of summer have disappeared, and the year is ready to fall into the arms of sterile winter. In the political world, small men have gradually displaced good men and great, till but one remains; and the lesson for him is to wait. The power operating against him is too strong; but the fashion of political life passes away. **If he wait, a change for the better will shortly appear.**

### COMMENTS

1. ䷖ denotes overthrowing or being overthrown. We see in the figure the weak lines threatening to change the last strong line into one of themselves.
2. That it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever appears from the fact that the small men are now growing and increasing. The superior man acts according to the exigency of the time, and stops all forward movement, looking at the significance of the symbolic figures in the hexagram. He values the processes of decrease and increase, of fulness and decadence, as seen in the movements of the heavenly bodies.

> The symbolic figures in the hexagram are ☷, below, the representative of docility, acting as circumstances require; and ☶, the representative of a mountain, which arrests the progress of the traveller. The superior man of the topmost line thus interprets them, and acts accordingly. Yet he is not left without hope. Winter is followed by spring; night is succeeded by day; the moon wanes, and then begins to wax again. So will it be in political life. In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☷ representing the earth, and above it ☶ that for a mountain, which adheres to the earth, form ䷖. Superiors, in accordance with this, seek to strengthen those below them, to secure the peace and stability of their own position.

> A mountain, stands out high above the earth; here it appears as lying on the earth, plainly it has been overturned. On the other hand, a mountain has the earth for its foundation. If the earth be thick, the mountain preserves its height. So it is with the sovereign and people. The application might be deduced from either view.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, divided, shows one overturning the couch by injuring its legs. The injury will go on tothe destruction of all firm correctness, and there will be evil.

> He overthrows the couch by injuring its legs; thushe commenceshis work of ruin with what is lowestin the superior man.

> The lesser symbolism is chiefly that of a bed or couch with its occupant. The idea of the hexagram requires this occupant to be overthrown, or at least that an attempt be made to overthrow him. Accordingly the attempt in line 1 is made by commencing with the legs of the couch. The symbolism goes on to explain itself. The object of the evil worker is the overthrow of all firm correctness. of course there will be evil.

> It is hard to tell whether the lowest in paragraph 1 should be supplemented as I have done. If not, then the explanation is a mere truism.

2. The second line, divided, shows one overthrowing the couch by injuring its frame.The injury will go on tothe destruction ofallfirm correctness, and there will be evil.

> He destroys the couch by injuring its frame; the superior manhas as yet no associates.

> Line 2 is to the same effect as 1; only the foe has advanced from the legs to the frame of the couch.

3. The third line, divided, shows its subject among the overthrowers; but there will be no error.

> There will be no error on the part of this one among the overthrowers, it arises from the difference between him and the others above and below.

> Line 3 also represents an overthrower; but it differs from the others in being the correlate of 6. The subject of it will take part with him. His association is with the subject of 6, and not, as in the other weak lines, with one of its own kind.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject having overthrown the couch, andgoing to injurethe skin of him who lies on it. There will be evil.

> He has overthrown the couch, andproceeds to injurethe skinof him who lies on it; calamity is very near at hand.

> From line 4 the danger is imminent. The couch has been overthrown. The person of the occupant is at the mercy of the destroyers.

5. The fifth line, divided, showsits subject leading on the others likea string of fishes, andobtaining for themthe favour that lights on the inmates of the palace. There will be advantage in every way.

> He obtains for them the favour that lights on the inmates of the palace; in the end there will be no grudge against him.

> With line 5 the symbolism changes. The subject of 5 is lord of all the other weak lines, and their subjects are at his disposal. He and they are represented as fishes, following one another as if strung together. All fishes come under the category of dark side. Then the symbolism changes again. The subject of 5, representing and controlling all the divided lines, is loyal to the subject of the sixth line. He is the rightful sovereign in his palace, and 5 leads all the others there to enjoy the sovereign's favours.

> The fifth line is weak, and yet occupies the most honourable place in the figure, emblematic of a queen; and as its subject leads on the subjects of the other lines to obtain the favours given to the inmates of the palace, she, it is plain, has neither jealousy nor any other injurious temper that might incur blame for tending to overthrow the ruler.

6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subjectasa great fruit which has not been eaten. The superior man findsthe people againas a chariot carrying him. The small menby their courseoverthrow their own dwellings.

> The superior man finds himself in a carriage; he is carried along by the people. The small menby their courseoverthrow their own dwellings; they can never again be of use to them.

> We have still different symbolism under line 6. Its strong subject, notwithstanding the attempts against him, survives, and acquires fresh vigour. The people again cherish their sovereign, and the plotters have wrought to their own overthrow.

> Line 6 shows the ruler restored to the favour of the people, and the restoration of concord in the state. The small men have done their worst, and there is an end of their attempts for a time.
