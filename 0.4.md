# ䷏ [Pleasure, Satisfaction] ☷∞☳

## 000.100

## JUDGMENT

䷏ indicates that, in the state which it implies, feudal princes may be set up, and the hosts put in motion, with advantage.

> The ䷏ denoted to king a condition of harmony and happy contentment throughout the kingdom, when the people rejoiced in and readily obeyed their sovereign. At such a time his appointments and any military undertakings would be hailed and supported. The fourth line, undivided, is the lord of the figure, and being close to the fifth or place of dignity, is to be looked on as the minister or chief officer of the ruler. The ruler gives to him his confidence; and all represented by the other lines yield their obedience.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷏ we see the strong line responded to by all the others, and the will of him whom it represents being carried out; and also docile obedience employing movement for its purposes. From these things comes ䷏ the Condition of harmony and satisfaction.
2. In this condition we have docile obedience employing movement for its purposes, and therefore it is so as between heaven and earth; how much more will it be so (among men) in the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion!
3. Heaven and earth show that docile obedience in connexion with movement, and hence the sun and moon make no error in time, and the four seasons do not deviate from their order. The sages show such docile obedience in connexion with their movements, and hence their punishments and penalties are entirely just, and the people acknowledge it by their submission. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in ䷏!

> Obedience is the attribute of ☷, the lower trigram, which takes the initiative in the action of the figure; and here makes use of the movement, which is the attribute of ☳, the upper trigram. Does it not proceed on the harmony produced by the thunderous explosion between heaven and earth. Then the analogy between natural phenomena and human and social experiences comes into play.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigrams ☷ ☳ for the earth and thunder issuing from it with its crashing noise form ䷏. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, composed their music and did honour to virtue, presenting it especially and most grandly to God, when they associated with him at the service their highest ancestor and their father.

> A thunderstorm clears the air and removes the feeling of oppression, of which one is conscious before its occurrence. Is this all that is meant by making the trigrams of the earth and thunder form ䷏, the hexagram of harmony and satisfaction. What is meant, moreover, by making the thunder issue, from the earth. The thunder crash suggested the use of music, as some critics do, is absurd. The use of music at sacrifices, however, as assisting the union produced by those services between God and his worshippers, and the present and past generations, agrees with the general idea of the figure.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line , divided, shows its subject proclaiming his pleasure and satisfaction. There will be evil.

> The subject of the first line proclaims his pleasure and satisfaction; there will be evil; his wishes have been satisfied to overflowing.

> Line 1 is weak, and has for its correlate the strong 4. Its subject may well enjoy the happiness of the time. But he cannot contain himself, and proclaims, or boasts of, his satisfaction; which is evil. 

> Pleasure has operated injuriously on the subject of line 1. He calls attention to himself.

2. The second line, divided, shows one who is firm as a rock. He sees a thing without waiting till it has come to pass; with his firm correctness there will be good fortune.

> He sees a thing without waiting till it has come to pass; with his firm correctness there will be good fortune; this is shown by the central and correct position of the line.

> Line 2, though weak, is in its correct position, the centre, moreover, of the lower trigram ☷. Quietly and firmly its subject is able to abide in his place, and exercise a far-seeing discrimination. All is indicative of good fortune. Only a part of the symbolism of line 2 is referred to here. Such an omission is not uncommon; as in lines 3 and 4 also.

3. The third line, divided, shows one looking up for favours, while he indulges the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction. If he would understand! If he be late in doing so, there will indeed be occasion for repentance.

> He looks up (for favours), while he indulges the feeling of satisfaction; there will be occasion for repentance; this is intimated by the position not being the appropriate one.

> Line 3 is weak, and in an odd place. Immediately below line 4, its subject keeps looking up to the lord of the figure, and depends on him, thinking of doing nothing, but how to enjoy himself. The consequence will be as described, unless he speedily change.

4. The fourth line, undivided, shows him from whom the harmony and satisfaction come. Great is the success which he obtains. Let him not allow suspicions to enter his mind, and thus friends will gather around him.

> From him the harmony and satisfaction come; great is the success which he obtains; his aims take effect on a grand scale.

> The strong subject of line 4 is the agent to whom the happy condition is owing; and it is only necessary to caution him to maintain his confidence in himself and his purpose, and his adherents and success will continue.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows one with a chronic complaint, but who lives on without dying.

> (The subject of) the fifth line has a chronic complaint; this is shown by his being mounted on the strong line. He still lives on without dying; he is in the central position, (and its memories of the past) have not yet perished.

> Line 5 is in the ruler's place; but it is weak, and he is in danger of being carried away by the lust of pleasure. Moreover, proximity to the powerful minister represented by 4 is a source of danger. Hence he is represented as suffering from a chronic complaint, but nevertheless he does not die. With the memories of the past not perishing.

6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject with darkened mind devoted to the pleasure and satisfaction of the time; but if he change his course even when it may be considered as completed, there will be no error.

> With darkened mind devoted to the harmony and satisfaction of the time, as shown in the topmost line; how can one in such a condition continue long?

> Line 6, at the very top or end of the hexagram, is weak, and its subject is all but lost. Still even for him there is a chance of safety, if he will but change. In line 6 the action of the hexagram is over. If one puts off changing his evil way any longer, there remains no more hope for him.
