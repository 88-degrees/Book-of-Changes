# ䷢ [Advancing] ☷∞☲

## 000.101

## JUDGMENT

In ䷢ we see a prince who secures the tranquillity of the people presented on that account with numerous horses by the king, and three times in a day received at interviews.

> ䷢ expresses its subject more fully and plainly than that of any of the previous thirty-four. It is about a feudal prince whose services to the country have made him acceptable to his king. The king's favour has been shown to him by gifts and personal attentions. The symbolism of the lines dimly indicates the qualities of such a prince. ䷢ means to advance. ䷭ and ䷴ agree with this in being called by names that indicate progress and advance. The advance in ䷢ is like that of the sun, the shining light, shining more and more to the perfect day.

### COMMENTS

1. ䷢ denotes advancing.
2. In ䷢ we have the bright sun appearing above the earth; the symbol of docile submission cleaving to that of the Great brightness; and the weak line advanced and moving above; all these things give us the idea of a prince who secures the tranquillity of the people, presented on that account with numerous horses by the king, and three times in a day received at interviews.

> The hexagrams have been formed by changes of the lines in manipulating with the divining stalks, that we have in the figure the weak line advanced and moving above, suggest the derivation of ䷢ from ䷊, whose 4th and 5th lines are made to change places. But we have seen that that view is inadmissible in the interpretation. And a simple explanation of the language at once presents itself. Of the three daughter trigrams it is only ䷉ which has its divided line occupying the central place of honour, when it is the upper trigram in a hexagram.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☷ representing the earth and that for the bright sun coming forth above it form ䷢. The superior man, according to this, gives himself to make more brilliant his bright virtue.

> The sun rising above the earth, and then travelling up to his meridian height, readily suggests the idea of advancing. On the application of this symbolism, of strong things there is none so strong as heaven; and hence the superior man after its pattern makes himself strong; of bright things there is none so bright as the sun, and after its pattern he makes himself bright.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, divided, shows one wishing to advance, and at the same time kept back. Let him be firm and correct, and there will be good fortune. If trust be not reposed in him, let him maintain a large and generous mind, and there will be no error.

> He appears wishing to advance, but at the same time being kept back; all-alone he pursues the correct course. 'Let him maintain a large and generous mind, and there will be no error; he has not yet received an official charge.

> Line 1 is weak, and in the lowest place, and its correlate in 4 is neither central nor in its correct position. This indicates the small and obstructed beginnings of his subject. But by his firm correctness he pursues the way to good fortune; and though the king does not yet believe in him, he the more pursues his noble course. If the subject of line 1 had received an official charge, then when unrecognised by his sovereign, and obstructed in his progress, his correct course would have been to cease to advance, and retire from the office in which he was not allowed to carry out his principles.

2. The second line, divided, shows its subject with the appearance of advancing, and yet of being sorrowful. If he be firm and correct, there will be good fortune. He will receive this great blessing from his grandmother.

> He will receive this great blessing; for he is in the central place and the correct position for him.

> Line 2 is weak, and its correlate in 5 is also weak. Its subject therefore has still to mourn in obscurity. But his position is central and correct, and he holds on his way, till success comes ere long. The symbolism says he receives at last this great blessing from the mild and compliant ruler.

3. The third line, divided, shows its subject trusted by all around him. All occasion for repentance will disappear.

> All around trust him; their common aim is to move upwards and act.

> Line 3 is weak, and in an odd place; but the subjects of 1 and 2 are possessed by the same desire to advance as the subject of this. A common trust and aim possess them; and hence the not unfavourable auspice.

4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject with the appearance of advancing, but like a marmot. However firm and correct he may be, the position is one of peril.

> He advances like a marmot. However firm and correct he may be, his position is one of peril; his place is not that appropriate for him.

> Line 4 is strong, but it is in an even place, nor is it central. It suggests the idea of a marmot or rat, stealthily advancing. Nothing could be more opposed to the ideal of the feudal lord in the hexagram.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows how all occasion for repentance disappears from its subjec). But let him not concern himself about whether he shall fail or succeed. To advance will be fortunate, and in every way advantageous.

> Let him not concern himself whether he fails or succeeds; his movement in advance will afford ground for congratulation.

> In line 5 that lord and his intelligent sovereign meet happily. He holds on his right course, indifferent as to results, but things are so ordered that he is, and will continue to be, crowned with success.

6. The topmost line, undivided, shows one advancing his horns. But he only uses them to punish the (rebellious people of his own) city. The position is perilous, but there will be good fortune. Yet however firm and correct he may be, there will be occasion for regret.

> He uses his horns only to punish (the rebellious people of) his city; his course of procedure is not yet brilliant.

> Line 6 is strong, and suggests the idea of its subject to the last continuing his advance, and that not only with firm correctness, but with strong force. The horns are an emblem of threatening strength, and though he uses them only in his own state, and against the rebellious there, that such a prince should have any occasion to use force is matter for regret. The course of procedure in line 6 has still an element of force in it, which is more than the firm correctness that was to him the ideal character of a feudal lord, and therefore his light is not yet that of the full-orbed sun.
