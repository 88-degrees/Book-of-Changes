# ䷦ [Difficulty Walking] ☶∞☵

## 001.010

## JUDGMENT

In the state indicated by ䷦ advantage will be found in the south-west, and the contrary in the north-east. It will be advantageous also to meet with the great man.In these circumstances, with firmness and correctness, there will be good fortune.

> ䷦ is the symbol for incompetency in the feet and legs, involving difficulty in walking; hence it is used in this hexagram to indicate a state of the kingdom which makes the government of it an arduous task. How this task may be successfully performed, now by activity on the part of the ruler, and now by a discreet inactivity; this is what the figure teaches, or at least gives hints about. For the development of the meaning of the symbolic character from the structure of the lineal figure.

> ䷦ seems to require three things: attention to place, the presence of the great man, and the firm observance of correctness; in order to cope successfully with the difficulties of the situation. The southwest is occupied by ☰ `111` , and the north-east by ☳ `001` . The former represents the champaign country; the latter, the mountainous region. The former is easily traversed and held; the latter, with difficulty. The attention to place thus becomes transformed into a calculation of circumstances; those that promise success in an enterprise, which should be taken advantage of, and those that threaten difficulty and failure, which should be shunned.

> This is the generally accepted view of this difficult passage. The idea of the great man is illustrated by the strong line in the fifth place, having for its correlate the weak line in 2. But favourableness of circumstances and place, and the presence of the great man do not dispense from the observance of firm correctness.

### COMMENTS

1. ䷦ denotes difficulty. There is the trigram ☶ expressive of perilousness in front. When one, seeing the peril, can arrest his steps in accordance with the significance of the lower trigram ☶, is he not wise?
2. The language of ䷦, that advantage will be found in the south-west, refers to the strong fifth line advanced and in the central place. That there will be no advantage in the north-east, intimates that the way of dealing with the ䷦ state is exhausted. That it will be advantageous to see the great man, intimates that advance will lead to achievement. That the places of the different lines after the first are those appropriate to them indicates firm correctness and good fortune, with which the regions of the kingdom are brought to their normal state. Great indeed is the work to be done in the time of ䷦!

> The upper or front trigram is ☵, the attribute of which is perilousness; the lower is ☶, of which the arresting, actively or passively, of movement or advance is the attribute. We can understand how the union of these attributes gives the ideas of difficulty and prudent caution.

> The advantageousness of the south-west is due to the central line in 5; there is no strong central line in it ☶.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☶ representing a mountain, and above it ☵ that for water, form ䷦. The superior man, in accordance with this, turns round and examines himself, and cultivates his virtue.

> We have here a steep and difficult mountain, and again on the top of that there is water; each of the two trigrams is an emblem of perilousness. There is peril, both above and below, in the figure; and hence it represents the difficulties of the state. When we do not, by what we do, realise what we desire, we must turn inwards and examine ourselves in every point.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. From the first line, divided, we learn that advance on the part of its subject will lead to greater difficulties, while remaining stationary will afford ground for praise.

> Advancing will conduct to greater difficulties, while remaining stationary will afford ground for praise; the proper course is to wait.

> Line 1 is weak, whereas it ought to be strong as being in an odd place. If its subject advance, he will not be able to cope with the difficulties of the situation, but be overwhelmed by them. Let him wait for a more favourable time.

2. The second line, divided, shows the minister of the king struggling with difficulty on difficulty, and not with a view to his own advantage.

> The minister of the king struggles with difficulty on difficulty; in the end no blame will be attached to him.

> Line 2 is weak, but in its proper place. Its correlation with the strong 5, and consequent significance, are well set forth. We saw that the moral value of conduct is independent of failure or success. Though the difficulties be too great for him to overcome, the sage accepts his desire, in order to stimulate others to loyal devotedness.

3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject advancing, but only to greater difficulties. He remains stationary, and returnsto his former associates.

> He advances,but only togreater difficulty; he remains stationary, and returns to his former associates; they, represented in the innertrigram, rejoice in him.

> Line 3 is strong, and in a place of strength; but its correlate in 6 is weak, so that the advance of its subject would be unsupported. He waits therefore for a better time, and cherishes the subjects of the two lines below, who naturally cling to him. Of the three lines of the lower trigram only the third is undivided, above the two others which are of the divided nature. They cling to it, and are represented as if rejoicing in it.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject advancing,but only togreater difficulties. He remains stationary, and uniteswith the subject of the line above.

> To advance will only be to encountergreater difficulties; he remains stationary, and unites with the subject of the line above; that is in its proper place and has the soliditydue to it in that position.

> Line 4 is weak, and, though in its proper place, its subject could do little of himself. He is immediately below the king or great man, however, and cultivates his loyal attachment to him, waiting for the time when he shall be required to act.

5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject struggling with the greatest difficulties, while friends are coming to help him.

> He struggles with the greatest difficulties, while friends are comingto help him; he is in the central position, and possesses the requisite virtue.

> Line 5 is the king, the man great and strong. He can cope with the difficulties, and the subjects of 2 and the other lines of the lower trigram give their help. The friends in Line 5 are the subjects of the second line, the correlate of 5, and also of the two other lines of the lower trigram.

6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject going forward, only to increase the difficulties, while his remaining stationary will beproductive of greatmerit. There will be good fortune, and it will be advantageous to meet with the great man.

> To advance willonly increase the difficulties, while his remaining stationary willbe productive of greatmerit; his aim is to assist thesubject of the line inside of him. It will be advantageous to meet the great man; by his course he follows that noblelord of the figure.

> The action of the hexagram is over; where can the weak 6 go forward to? Let him abide where he is, and serve the great man immediately below him. So shall he also be great; in meritorious action at least. By the inside, and the noble, we are to understand the subject of line 5.
