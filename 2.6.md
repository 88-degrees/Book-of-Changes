# ䷮ [Straitened, Distressed] ☵∞☱

## 010.110

## JUDGMENT ATTRIBUTED TO KING WAN)

In the condition denoted by ☵ there may yet be progress and success. For the firm and correct, the really great man, there will be good fortune. He will fall into no error. If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good.

> The character ䷮ presents us with the picture of a tree within an enclosure; a plant, fading for want of room; a tree not allowed to spread its branches. However this be, the term conveys the idea of being straitened and distressed; and this hexagram indicates a state of things in which the order and government that would conduce to the well-being of the country can hardly get the development, which, by skilful management on the part of 'the great man' and others, is finally secured for them.

> Looking at the figure we see that the two central places are occupied by strong lines; but 2 is confined between 1 and 3, both of which are weak, and 5 the ruler, as well as 4 his minister, is covered by the weak 6; all which peculiarities are held to indicate the repression or straitening of good men by bad. For the way in which the same view is derived from the great symbolism, see Symbolism below.

> For changing one character so as to give the meaning in the translation. Actions, not words, are what are required in the case.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷮ we see the strong lines covered and obscured by the weak.
2. We have in it the attribute of perilousness going on to that of satisfaction. Who is it but the superior man that, though straitened, still does not fail in making progress to his proper end?

> For the firm and correct, the really great man, there will be good fortune; this is shown by the central positions of the strong lines.
If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good; to be fond of arguing or pleading is the way to be reduced to extremity.

> One sees the relative position of the strong and weak lines in the figure; but to deduce from that the idea expressed by ䷮ requires a painful straining of the imagination. That idea was in the mind, and then the lines were interpreted accordingly.

2. Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram ☵ and satisfaction that of the upper ☱. The superior man, however straitened, remains master of himself, and pursues the proper end of principle settled in his mind.

> Why should the subject of ䷮ make speeches, be fond of arguing or pleading, as the characters say, if we could translate them literally, setting a value on the mouth? The reply to this is found in the trigram denoting satisfaction, or being pleased. The party in the extremity of ䷮ yet wishes and tries to make men pleased with him.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☱ representing a marsh, and below it that for a defile, which has drained the other dry so that there is no water in it, form ䷮. The superior man, in accordance with this, will sacrifice his life in order to carry out his purpose.

> It would be 'a marsh with no water is ䷮; and this might certainly suggest to us a condition of distress. But how does this come out of the trigrams? The upper one is ☱, representing a marsh; and the lower is ☵, representing water in a defile. The collocation of the two suggests the running of the water from the marsh or lake into the stream, which will soon empty the other. The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above will become dry. The application is good in itself, but the concatenation between it and the Symbolism is hardly discernible.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, divided, shows its subject with bare buttocks straitened under the stump of a tree. He enters a dark valley, and for three years has no prospect of deliverance).

> He enters a dark valley; so benighted is he, and without clear vision.

> The symbolism of buttocks is rather a favourite; everyone has their taste. The poor subject of line 1 sitting on a mere stump, which affords him no shelter, is indeed badly off. The line is at the bottom of the trigram indicating peril, and 4, which is its proper correlate, is so circumstanced as not to be able to render it help; hence comes the unfavourable auspice. Three years is used, as often, for a long time. So stupid is the subject of line 1 that by his own act he increases his distress.

2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject straitened amidst his wine and viands. There come to him anon the red knee-covers of the ruler. It will be well for him to maintain his sincerity as in sacrificing. Active operations on his part will lead to evil, but he will be free from blame.

> He is straitened amidst his wine and viands; but his position is central, and there will be ground for congratulation.

> The three strong lines in the figure 2, 4, and 5 are all held to represent superior men; and their being straitened is not in their persons or estates, but in their principles which are denied development. Hence the subject of 2 is straitened while he fares sumptuously. His correlate in 5, though not quite proper, occupies the ruler's place, and comes to his help. That it is the ruler who comes appears from his red or vermillion knee-covers, different from the scarlet knee-covers worn by nobles, as in paragraph 5. Let 2 cultivate his sincerity and do the work of the hexagram as if he were sacrificing to spiritual beings; and then, if he keep quiet, all will be well. The ground for congratulation in paragraph 2 is the banqueting and sacrificing. I rather think it is the measure of help, which it is intimated the subject will give in removing the straitness and distress of the time.

3. The third line, divided, shows its subject straitened before a frowning rock. He lays hold of thorns. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife. There will be evil.

> He lays hold of thorns; this is suggested by the position of the line above the strong line. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife; this is inauspicious.

> The subjects of the three divided lines 1, 3, and 6 are all unable to deal aright with the straitened state indicated by the figure. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The second, occupies the third place, where he may either advance or retreat; and he advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to his family, and finds none to receive him; so graphically is there set forth the distress which reckless action brings.

4. The fourth line, undivided shows its subject proceeding very slowly to help the subject of the first line, who is straitened by the carriage adorned with metal in front of him. There will be occasion for regret, but the end will be good.

> He proceeds very slowly to help the subject of the first line; his aim is directed to help that lower line. Although he is not in his appropriate place, he and that other will in the end be together.

> Line 4 is the proper correlate of 1, but it is a strong line in an even place, and its assistance is given dilatorily. Then 1 is overridden by 2, which is represented by 'a chariot of metal.' It is difficult for the subjects of 1 and 4 to come together, and effect much; but 4 is near 5, which is also a strong line. Through a common sympathy, the subject of 5 will have a measure of success.

5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject with his nose and feet cut off. He is straitened by his ministers in their scarlet aprons. He is leisurely in his movements, however, and is satisfied. It will be well for him to be as sincere as in sacrificing to spiritual beings.

> His nose and feet are cut off; his aim has not yet been gained. He is leisurely, however, in his movements, and is satisfied; his position is central and his virtue is correct. It will be well for him to be as sincere as in sacrificing; so shall he receive blessing.

> Line 5 is repressed by 6, and pressed on by 4. Above and below its subject is wounded. Especially is he straitened by the minister in 4, with his scarlet knee-covers. But the upper trigram is ☱, with the quality of complacent satisfaction. And this indicates, it is said, that the subject of 5 gets on notwithstanding his straits, especially by his sincerity. This explanation is not more satisfactory than the last.

6. The sixth line, divided, shows its subject straitened, as if bound with creepers; or in a high and dangerous position, and saying to himself, If I move, I shall repent it. If he do repent of former errors, there will be good fortune in his going forward.

> He is straitened as if bound with creepers; his spirit and action are unsuitable. He says, If I move, I shall repent of it. And he does repent of former errors, which leads to good fortune; so he now goes on.

> Line 6 is at the top of the figure, where the distress may be supposed to reach its height. Its subject appears bound and on a perilous summit. But his extremity is also his opportunity. He is moved to think of repenting; and if he do repent, and go forward, his doing so will be fortunate.
