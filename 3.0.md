# ䷭ [Ascending Upwards] ☴∞☷

## 011.000

## JUDGMENT

䷭ indicates that under its conditions there will be great progress and success. Seeking by the qualities implied in it to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety. Advance to the south will be fortunate.

> The character ䷭ is used of advancing in an upward direction, advancing and ascending. And here, as the name of the hexagram, it denotes the advance of a good officer to the highest pinnacle of distinction. The second line, in the centre of the lower trigram ☴, is strong, but the strength is tempered by its being in an even place. As the representative of the subject of the hexagram, it shows him to be possessed of modesty and force. Then the ruler's seat, the fifth place, is occupied by a divided line, indicating that he will welcome the advance of 2. The officer therefore both has the qualities that fit him to advance, and a favourable opportunity to do so. The result of his advance will be fortunate.

> It is said that after he has met with the ruler, the great man in 5, advance to the south will be fortunate. Advancing to the south is equivalent simply to advancing forwards. The south is the region of brightness and warmth; advance towards it will be a joyful progress. The traveller will proceed a straight way in which we go to the austrates and happy; most resembles that of the plagues.

### COMMENTS

1. We find the weak line, as it finds the opportunity, ascending upwards.
2. We have the attribute of flexibility and that of obedience; we have the strong line below and its proper correlate above; these things indicate that there will be 'great progress and success.
3. Seeking by the qualities implied in ䷭ to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety; there will be ground for congratulation. Advance to the south will be fortunate; his aim will be carried out.

> The explanation of the first paragraph has given occasion to much difference of opinion. Some will have the weak line to be 4; some 5; and some the whole of ☷, the upper trigram. The advocates of 4, make it come from hexagram ䷧, the weak 3 of which ascends to the strong 4, displaces it, and takes its place; but we have seen repeatedly the folly of the doctrine of changing lines and figures. The Symbolism below suggests the proper explanation. The lower trigram, ☴, represents here not wind but wood. The first line, weak, is the root of a tree planted beneath the earth. Its gradual growth symbolises the advance upwards of the subject of the hexagram, fostered, that is, by the circumstances of the time.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☴ representing wood and that for the earth with the wood growing in the midst of it form ䷭. The superior man, in accordance with this, pays careful attention to his virtue, and accumulates the small developments of it till it is high and great.

> See what has been said on the judgment above. The application which is made of it here may be accepted, though it has nothing to do with the teaching of the Text about the gradual rise of a good officer to high social distinction and influence.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, divided, shows its subject advancing upwards with the welcome of those above him. There will be great good fortune.

> He is welcomed in his advance upwards, and there will be great good fortune; the subjects of the upper trigram ☷ are of the same mind with him.

> Line 1 is weak, where it should be strong; its subject, that is, is humble and docile. Those above him, therefore, welcome his advance. As the first line of ☴, moreover, it may be supposed to concentrate in itself its attribute of docility, and be the lord of the trigram. Instead of finding in this the three lines of ☷ and their subjects, the upper denote only line 2.

2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject with that sincerity which will make even the small offerings of the vernal sacrifice acceptable. There will be no error.

> The sincerity of the subject of the second line, undivided, affords occasion for joy.

> See on the second line of ䷬. Line 2 is strong, and the weak 5 is its proper correlate. We have a strong officer serving a weak ruler; he could not do so unless he were penetrated with a sincere and devoted loyalty. The subject of line 2 in his loyal devotion to 5 will do much good and benefit many; hence we have the words, affords occasion for joy.

3. The third line , undivided, shows its subject ascending upwards as into an empty city.

> He advances upwards as into an empty city; he has no doubt or hesitation.

> Line 3 describes the boldness and fearlessness of the advance of the third line. There is a shade of condemnation in the line. Its subject is too bold. He has no doubt or hesitation; but this is presuming rather on his strength.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject employed by the king to present his offerings on mountain. There will be good fortune; there will be no mistake.

> The king employs him to prevent his offerings on mountain; such a service of spiritual Beings is according to their mind.

> Line 4 occupies the place of a great minister, in immediate contiguity to his ruler, who confides in him, and raises him to the highest distinction as a feudal prince. The mention of mountain, at the foot of which was the capital of the lords, seems to take the paragraph out of the sphere of symbolism into that of history. The king in it is the last sovereign of ䷭; the feudal prince in it. Such an employment of men of worth to do service to spiritual Beings is serving them according to their mind.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows its subject firmly correct, and therefore enjoying good fortune. He ascends the stairs with all due ceremony.

> He is firmly correct, and will therefore enjoy good fortune. He ascends the stairs with all due ceremony; he grandly succeeds in his aim.

> In line 5 the advance has reached the highest point of dignity, and firm correctness is specially called for. Ascending the steps of a stair may intimate, the ease of the advance; or according to others, its ceremonious manner.

6. The sixth line, divided, shows its subject advancing upwards blindly. Advantage will be found in a ceaseless maintenance of firm correctness.

> He blindly advances upwards, and is in the highest place; but there is decay in store for him, and he will not preserve his riches.

> What can the subject of the hexagram want more? He has gained all his wishes, and still he is for going onwards. His advance is blind and foolish; and only the most exact correctness will save him from the consequences. When one has reached the greatest height, he should think of retiring. Ambition otherwise may overleap itself.
