# ䷑ [Arresting Decay] ☴∞☶

## 011.001

## JUDGMENT

䷑ indicates great progress and success to him who deals properly with the condition represented by it. There will be advantage in efforts like that of crossing the great stream. He should weigh well, however, the events of three days before the turning point, and those to be done three days after it.

> They who follow another are sure to have services to perform, and hence ䷐ is followed by ䷑. But ䷑ means the having painful or troublesome services to do. It denotes here a state in which things are going to ruin, as if through poison or venomous worms; and the figure is supposed to describe the arrest of the decay and the restoration to soundness and vigour, so as to justify its auspice of great progress and success. To realise such a result, however, great efforts will be required, as in crossing the great stream; and a careful consideration of the events that have brought on the state of decay, and the measures to be taken to remedy it is also necessary. See the Comments below on the three days.

> The subject of line 1, and of all the other lines, excepting perhaps 6, appears as a son. Yet the line itself is of the yin nature, and the trigram in which it plays the principal part is also yin. Line 2 is strong, and of the yang nature, with the yin line 5 as its proper correlate. In line 2, 5 appears as the mother; but its subject there is again a son, and the upper trigram altogether is yang. I am unable to account for these things. These lines of the Amorites, from the mother to the denomination is merely translatitia these things, and, as the record vulgaris, to the explanation of the tower to the Sentences of them according to its mother, and for his son, it must be said. Nor is it the mystery of, look for the name of the account will be given, if any man is in either. Why are other people in the shapes of lines now king, but now Vasallos, already government minister and then chief weapons charge report called? That is applied to the word lines, words in a sentence sense queniadmodum making techniques of the book.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷑ we have the strong trigram ☶ above, and the weak one ☴ below; we have below pliancy, and above stopping; these give the idea of ䷑, a Troublous Condition of affairs verging to ruin.
2. ䷑ indicates great progress and success; through the course shown in it, all under heaven, there will be good order. There will be advantage in crossing the great stream; he who advances will encounter the business to be done. He should weigh well, however, the events of three days before the turning-point, and those to be done three days after it; the end of confusion is the beginning of order; such is the procedure of Heaven.

> The symbolism here is the opposite of that in ䷐. The upper trigram ☶ is strong, denoting, the youngest son; and the lower, ☴, is weak, denoting the eldest daughter. For the eldest daughter to be below the youngest son is eminently correct, and helps to indicate the auspice of great success. The attribute of ☴ is pliancy, and that of ☶ stoppage or arrest. The feeble pliancy confronted by the arresting mountain gives an idea of the evil state implied in ䷑.

> Three days before and after the turning-point is the name of the first of the earthly stems among the cyclical characters. Hence it has the meaning of beginning, and here denotes the turning-point, at which disorder gives place to order. According to the procedure of Heaven, history is a narrative of change, one condition of affairs constantly giving place to another and opposite. A kingdom that cannot be moved does not enter into the circle of ideas.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☶ for a mountain, and below it ☴ that for wind, form ䷑. The superior man, in accordance with this, (addresses himself to) help the people and nourish his own virtue.

> When the wind, encounters the mountain, it is driven back, and the things about are all scattered in disorder; such is the emblem of the state denoted by ䷑. The nourishing of virtue appears especially in line 6; all the other lines belong to the helping of the people.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, divided, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by his father. If he be an able son, the father will escape the blame of having erred. The position is perilous, but there will be good fortune in the end.

> He deals with the troubles caused by his father; he feels that he has entered into the work of his father.

> Line 1 is weak, and its correlate 4 is also weak. What can its subject do to remedy the state of decay? But the line is the first of the figure, and the decay is not yet great. By giving heed to the cautions in the Text, he will accomplish what is promised. The subject of line 1 has entered into the work of his father, and brings it about that his father is looked on as blameless.

2. The second line, undivided, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by his mother. He should not carry his firm correctness to the utmost.

> He deals with the troubles caused by his mother; he holds to the course of the due mean.

> The ruler in line 5 is represented by a weak line, while 2 is strong. Thus the symbolism takes the form of a son dealing with the prevailing decay induced somehow by his mother. But a son must be very gentle in all his intercourse with his mother, and especially so, when constrained by a sense of duty to oppose her course. I do not think there is anything more or better to be said here. It would give to ䷑ the meaning of misfortunes endured, instead of troubles caused. The due mean of line 2 is according to the caution in the Text.

3. The third line, undivided, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by his father. There may be some small occasion for repentance, but there will not be any great error.

> He deals with the troubles caused by his father; in the end there will be no error.

> Line 3 is strong, and not central, so that its subject might well go to excess in his efforts. But this tendency is counteracted by the line's place in the trigram ☴, often denoting lowly submission.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows a son viewing indulgently the troubles caused by his father. If he go forward, he will find cause to regret it.

> He views indulgently the troubles caused by his father; if he go forward, he will not succeed.

> Line 4 is weak, and in an even place, which intensifies that weakness. Hence comes the caution against going forward.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by his father. He obtains the praise of using the fit instrument for his work.

> He deals with the troubles caused by his father, and obtains praise; he is responded to by the subject of line two with all his virtue.

> The weak line 5, as has been said, is the seat of the ruler; but its proper correlate is the strong 2, the strong siding champion minister, to whom the work of the hexagram is delegated. The explanation of line 5 as he takes up the course of his father with all his virtue.

6. The sixth line, undivided, shows us one who does not serve either king or feudal lord, but in a lofty spirit prefers to attend to his own affairs.

> He does not serve either king or feudal lord; but his aim may be a model to others.

> Line 6 is strong, and has no proper correlate below. Hence it suggests the idea of one outside the sphere of action, and taking no part in public affairs, but occupied with the culture of himself.
