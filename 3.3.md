# ䷸ [Wind, Penetrating] ☴∞☴

## 011.011

## JUDGMENT

䷸ intimates that under the conditions which it denotes there will be some little attainment and progress. There will be advantage in movement onward in whatever direction. It will be advantageous also to see the great man.

> ☴ symbolises both wind and wood; and has the attributes of flexibility nearly allied to docility and penetration. In this hexagram we are to think of it as representing wind with its penetrating power, finding its way into every corner and cranny.

> The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows upon it. In accordance with this, the subject of the hexagram must be understood as the influence and orders of government designed to remedy what is wrong in the people. The upper trigram denotes the orders issuing from the ruler, and the lower the obedience rendered to them by the people.

> But how is it that the figure represents merely some little attainment? This is generally explained by taking the first line of the trigram as indicating what the subject of it can do. But over the weak first line are two strong lines, so that its subject can accomplish but little. The idea of the whole figure being penetration, line 1, the symbol of weakness and what is bad, will not be able to offer much resistance to the subjects of the other lines, which will enter and dispel its influence. They illustrate this from processes of nature, education, and politics; the effect they say is described as small, because the process is not to revolutionise or renew, but only to correct and improve. Such as it is, however, it requires the operation of the strong and virtuous, the great man. Even all this criticism is not entirely satisfactory.

### COMMENTS

1. The double ䷸ shows how, in accordance with it, governmental orders are reiterated.
2. We see that the strong fifth line has penetrated into the central and correct place, and the will of its subject is being carried into effect; we see also the weak first and fourth lines both obedient to the strong lines above them. It is hence said, There will be some little attainment and progress. There will be advantage in movement onward in whatever direction. It will be advantageous also to see the great man.

> The obedience of the weak lines to the strong ones grows, in a way not very perceptible, from the idea of the hexagram, and the quality of the trigram as denoting penetration and flexibility.

### SYMBOLISM

Two trigrams ☴ representing wind, following each other, form ䷸. The superior man, in accordance with this, reiterates his orders, and secures the practice of his affairs.

> Some commentators make the upper trigram symbolical of the ordinances of the ruler and the lower symbolical of the obedience of the people. Superiors, in harmony with the duty of inferiors, issue their commands; inferiors, in harmony with the wishes of their superiors, follow them. Above and below there are that harmony and deference; and this is the significance of the redoubled ☴. When governmental commands and business are in accordance with what is right, they agree with the tendencies of the minds of the people who follow them.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, divided, shows its subject now advancing, now receding. It would be advantageous for him to have the firm correctness of a brave soldier.

> Now he advances, now he recedes; his mind is perplexed. It would be advantageous for him to have the firmness of a brave soldier; his mind would in that case be well governed.

> Line 1 is weak, where it should be strong. The movements of its subject are expressive of perplexity. He wants vigour and decision.

2. The second line, undivided, shows the representative of ䷸ beneath a couch, and employing diviners and exorcists in a way bordering on confusion. There will be good fortune and no error.

> The good fortune springing from what borders on confusion is due to the position of the line in the centre.

> Line 2 is strong, and in the right place, and has a good auspice. Things are placed or hidden beneath a couch or bed; and the subject of the line appears as searching for them. He calls in divination to assist his judgment, and exorcists to expel for him what is bad. The work is great and difficult, so that he appears almost distracted by it; but the issue is good. The sincerity of purpose indicated by the central position of the second line conducts its subject to the right course, despite the many considerations that might distract him.

3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject penetrating only by violent and repeated efforts. There will be occasion for regret.

> The regret arising from the violent and repeated efforts to penetrate shows the exhaustion of the will.

> Line 3 is in the right place for a strong line. But its position at the top of the lower trigram is supposed to indicate the restlessness, and here the vehemence, of its subject. And 6 is no proper correlate. All the striving is ineffective, and there is occasion for regret. The will is exhausted in paragraph 3 intimates that 'the repeated efforts' made by its subject have exhausted him. He can now only regret his failures.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows all occasion for repentance in its subject passed away. He takes game for its threefold use in his hunting.

> He takes game in his hunting, enough for the threefold use of it; he achieves merit.

> Line 4 is weak, as is its correlate in 1. But 4 is a proper place for a weak line, and it rests under the shadow of the strong and central 5. Hence the omens of evil are counteracted; and a good auspice is obtained. The game caught in hunting was divided into three portions; the first for use in sacrifices; the second for the entertainment of visitors; and the third for the kitchen generally. A hunt which yielded enough for all these purposes was deemed very successful.

5. The fifth line, undivided, shows that with firm correctness there will be good fortune to its subject. All occasion for repentance will disappear, and all his movements will be advantageous. There may have been no good beginning, but there will be a good end. Three days before making any changes, let him give notice of them; and three days after, let him reconsider them. There will thus be good fortune.

> The good fortune of the subject of the fifth line, undivided, is owing to its correct position and its being in the centre.

> It is the seat of honour, and the place for the lord of ䷸, from whom there issue all charges and commands. It is central and correct; we must find in its subject the qualities denoted by ䷸ in their greatest excellence. But those qualities are docility and accordance with what is right; and the advantage of firm correctness is insisted on. With this all will be right. With the concluding sentence compare the conclusion of the judgment of hexagram [䷑](3.1.md).

6. The sixth line, undivided, shows the representative of penetration beneath a couch, and having lost the axe with which he executed his decisions. However firm and correct he may try to be, there will be evil.

> The representative of penetration is beneath a couch; though occupying the topmost place, his powers are exhausted. He has lost the axe with which he executed his decisions; though he try to be correct, there will be evil.

> The evil that paragraph 6 concludes with would arise from the quality of ䷸ being carried to excess.
