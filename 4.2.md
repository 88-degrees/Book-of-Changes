## JUDGMENT

䷂ indicates that in the case which it presupposes there will be great progress and success, and the advantage will come from being correct and firm. But any movement in advance should not be lightly undertaken. There will be advantage in appointing feudal princes.

> The character called ䷂ is pictorial, and was intended to show us how a plant struggles with difficulty out of the earth, rising gradually above the surface. This difficulty, marking the first stages in the growth of a plant, is used to symbolise the struggles that mark the rise of a state out of a condition of disorder, consequent on a great revolution. The same thing is denoted by the combination of the trigrams that form the figure; as will be seen in the notes on it under Symbolism, below.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷂ we have the strong ☰ and the weak ☷ commencing their intercourse, and difficulties arising.
2. Movement in the midst of peril gives rise to 'great progress and success, through firm correctness.
3. By the action of the thunder and rain, which are symbols of ☳ and ☵, all between heaven and earth is filled up. But the condition of the time is full of irregularity and obscurity. Feudal princes should be established, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged even then.

> ䷂ is made up of the trigrams ☳ and ☵. On the first application of ☷ to ☰, there results ☳, the first line of ☰ taking the place of the last of ☷; and on the second application, there results ☵, the middle line of ☰ taking the place of that of ☷. The six symbols, ☱, ☲, ☳, ☴, ☵, ☶, come from ☰ and ☷. The ䷂ diagram represents the hard and the soft air beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering.

> There is an attempt from the virtues or attributes assigned to the trigrams to make out the result indicated in the judgment. To move and excite is the quality of ☳; perilousness is the quality of ☵. The power to move is likely to produce great effects; to do this in perilous and difficult circumstances requires firmness and correctness.

> ䷂ depicts a condition of trouble and disorder in the natural world occasioned by the phenomena that are symbols of the significance of ☳ and ☵; but this is symbolical again of the disorder and distress, political and social, characteristic of the time. Good princes throughout the nation would help to remedy that; but the supreme authority should not resign itself to indifference, trusting to them.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☵ representing clouds and ☳ that representing thunder form ䷂. The superior man, in accordance with this, adjusts his measures of government as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof.

> ☵ represents water, especially in the form of rain. Here its symbol is a cloud. The whole hexagram seems to place us in the atmosphere of a thunderous sky overhung with thick and gloomy clouds, when we feel oppressed and distressed. This is not a bad emblem of the political state in the mind of the writer. When the thunder has pealed, and the clouds have discharged their burden of rain, the atmosphere is cleared, and there is a feeling of relief. But I fail again to discern clearly the connexion between the symbolism and the lesson about the superior man's administration of affairs.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, undivided, shows the difficulty its subject has in advancing. It will be advantageous for him to abide correct and firm; advantageous also to be made a feudal ruler.

> Although there is a difficulty in advancing, the mind of the subject of the line is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people.

> The first line is undivided, showing the strength of its subject. He will be capable of action, and his place in the trigram of mobility will the more dispose him to it. But above him is the trigram of peril; and the lowest line of that, to which especially he must look for response and co-operation, is divided and weak. Hence arise the ideas of difficulty in advancing, the necessity of caution, and the advantage of his being clothed with authority. The subject of the first line of the Symbolism is represented by the undivided line, and therefore is firm and correct. He is noble, but his place is below the divided lines, symbols of the weak and mean.

2. The second line, divided, shows its subject distressed and obliged to return; even the horses of her chariot also seem to be retreating. But not by a spoiler is she assailed, but by one who seeks her to be his wife. The young lady maintains her firm correctness, and declines a union. After ten years she will be united, and have children.

> The difficulty to the subject of the second line, divided, arises from, its place over the undivided line below it. The union and children after ten years shows things resuming their regular course.

> To the subject of the second line, divided, advance is still more difficult. He is weak in himself; he is pressed by the subject of the strong line below him. But happily that subject, though strong, is correct; and above in the fifth line, in the place of authority, is the strong one, union with whom and the service of whom should be the objects pursued. All these circumstances suggested to the duke the idea of a young lady, sought in marriage by a strong wooer, when marriage was unsuitable, rejecting him, and finally, after ten years, marrying a more suitable, the only suitable, match for her. Things resume their regular course; the subject is now at liberty to seek a union with the subject of line 5, according to the rules of the symbolism. Lines 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6, the corresponding lilies of the trigrams, are correlates.

3. The third line, divided, shows one following the deer without the guidance of the forester, and only finding himself in the midst of the forest. The superior man, acquainted with the secret risks, thinks it better to give up the chase. If he went forward, he would regret it.

> One pursues the deer without the guidance of the forester; he does so in his eagerness to follow the game. The superior man gives up the chase, knowing that if he go forward he will regret it; he would be reduced to extremity.

> The third line is divided, not central, and the number of its place is appropriate to the occupancy of a strong line. All these things should affect the symbolism of the line. But the outcome of the whole hexagram being good, the superior man sees the immediate danger and avoids it.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject as a lady, the horses of whose chariot appear in retreat. She seeks, however, the help of him who seeks her to be his wife. Advance will be fortunate; all will turn out advantageously.

> Going forward after such a search for a helper shows intelligence.

> The subject of the fourth line, the first of the upper trigram ☵, has recourse to the strong suitor of line 1, the first of the lower trigram ☳; and with his help is able to cope with the difficulties of the position, and go forward. The subject of line 4 naturally recurs to the correlate in line 1. He is the natural helper in the case, and he has the ability.

5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the difficulties in the way of its subject's dispensing the rich favours that might be expected from him. With firmness and correctness there will be good fortune in small things; even with them in great things there will be evil.

> Difficulty is experienced by the subject of the fifth line in bestowing his rich favours; the extent to which they reach will not yet be conspicuous.

> The subject of the fifth line is in the place of authority, and should show himself a ruler, dispensing benefits on a great scale. But he is in the very centre of the trigram denoting perilousness, and line 2, which responds to 5, is weak. Hence arises the symbolism, and great things should not be attempted.

6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject with the horses of his chariot obliged to retreat, and weeping tears of blood in streams.

> He weeps tears of blood in streams; how can the state thus emblemed continue long?

> The sixth line is weak; the third responding to it is also weak it is at the extremity of peril; the game is up. What can remain for its subject in such a case but terror and abject weeping?
