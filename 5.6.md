# ䷰ [Change] ☲∞☱

## 101.110

## JUDGMENT

What takes place as indicated by ䷰ is believed in only after it has been accomplished. There will be great progress and success. Advantage will come from being firm and correct. In that case occasion for repentance will disappear.

> ䷰ is used in the sense of changing. Originally used for the skin of an animal or bird, alive or dead, it received the significance of changing at a very early time. How the transition was made from the idea of a skin or hide to that of change is a subject that need not be entered on here. The subject of changes occurring called for in the state of the country; it may be on the greatest scale. The necessity of them is recognised, and hints are given as to the spirit and manner in which they should be brought about.

> For the way in which the notion of change is brought out of the trigrams of the figure, see the comments and symbolism below. It is assumed in the judgment that change is viewed by people generally with suspicion and dislike, and should not be made hastily. When made as a necessity, and its good effects appear, the issues will be great and good. A proved necessity for them beforehand; and a firm correctness in the conduct of them; these are the conditions by which changes should be regulated.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷰ we see water and fire extinguishing each other; we see also two daughters dwelling together, but with their minds directed to different objects; on account of these things it is called the hexagram of Change.
2. It is believed in only after it has been accomplished; when the change has been made, faith is accorded to it. We have cultivated intelligence as the basis of pleased satisfaction, suggesting great progress and success, coming from what is correct. When change thus takes place in the proper way, occasion for repentance disappears.
3. Heaven and earth undergo their changes, and the four seasons complete their functions. In accordance with the will of Heaven, and in response to the wishes of men. Great indeed is what takes place in a time of change.

> ☲, the lower trigram, represents fire, and ☱, the upper, represents water. Water will extinguish fire, and fire again will dry up water. Each, to all appearance, produces a change in the other. Again, according to king's scheme of the trigrams, ☲ is the second, and ☱ the youngest daughter. Their wills are likely to differ in love and other things; but this symbolism does not so readily suggest the idea of change.

> The first sentence suggests how the dislike to change on the part of people generally is overcome.
The second suggests how change proceeding from intelligence and giving general satisfaction will be successful.

> Paragraph 3 tells us how the greatest natural and the greatest political changes are equally successful and admirable when conducted aright.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☱ representing the waters of a marsh and that for fire in the midst of them form ䷰. The superior man, in accordance with this, regulates his astronomical calculations, and makes clear the seasons and times.

> Wise men, occupying themselves with the determination of the seasons and questions of time, have in all ages based their judgments on the observation of the heavenly bodies.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject as if he were bound with the skin of a yellow ox.

> He is bound with the skin of a yellow ox; he should in his circumstances be taking action.

> Line 1, at the bottom of the figure, may be taken as denoting change made at too early a period. It has no proper correlate or helper, moreover, above. Hence its subject is represented as tied up, unable to take any action.

2. The second line, divided, shows its subject making his changes after some time has passed. Action taken will be fortunate. There will be no error.

> He makes his changes when some time has passed; what he does will be matter of admiration.

> Line 2, though weak, is in its correct place. It is in the centre also of the trigram ☲, signifying brightness and intelligence, and has a proper correlate in the strong 5. Let its subject take action in the way of change.

3. The third line, undivided, shows that action taken by its subject will be evil. Though he be firm and correct, his position is perilous. If the change he contemplates have been three times fully discussed, he will be believed in.

> The change contemplated has been three times fully discussed; to what else should attention now be directed?

> The symbolism of paragraph 3 is twofold. The line is strong, and in the correct position, but it has passed the centre of ☴ and is on its outward verge. These conditions may dispose its subject to reckless and violent changing which would be bad. But if he act cautiously and with due deliberation, he may take action, and he will be believed in.

4. The fourth line, undivided, shows occasion for repentance disappearing from its subject. Let him be believed in; and though he change existing ordinances, there will be good fortune.

> The good fortune consequent on changing existing ordinances is due to the faith reposed in his aims.

> Line 4 is strong, but in the place of a weak line. This might vitiate any action of its subject in the way of change, and give occasion for repentance. But other conditions are intimated that will have a contrary effect; and if he have further secured general confidence, he may proceed to the greatest changes, even to change the dynasty, with good fortune. The conditions favourable to his action are said to be such as these; The line has passed from the lower trigram into the upper; water and fire come in it into contact; the fourth place is that of the minister immediately below the ruler's seat. All these considerations demand action from the subject of 4 in harmony with the idea of the hexagram.

5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the great man producing his changes as the tiger does when he changes his stripes. Before he divines and proceeds to action, faith has been reposed in him.

> The great man produces his changes as the tiger does when he changes his stripes; their beauty becomes more brilliant.

> Line 5 has every quality proper to the lord of the hexagram, and his action will be in every way beneficial. He is symbolled by the tiger; and the changes which he makes by the bright stripes of the tiger when he has changed his coat.

6. The sixth line, divided, shows the superior man producing his changes as the leopard does when he changes his spots, while small men change their faces and show their obedience. To go forward now would lead to evil, but there will be good fortune in abiding firm and correct.

> The superior man produces his changes as the leopard does when he changes his spots; their beauty becomes more elegant. Small men change their faces; they show themselves prepared to follow their ruler.

> Line 6 is weak, but its subject is penetrated with the spirit of the hexagram. If its subject be a superior man, only inferior to the great man, immediately below, the changes he makes will be inferior only to his. If he be a small man, he will be compliant and submissive. The lesson for him, however, is to abide firm and correct without taking any action of his own.
