# ䷌ [Union of Men] ☲∞☰

## 101.111

## JUDGMENT

䷌ or Union of men appears here as we find it in the remote districts of the country, indicating progress and success. It will be advantageous to cross the great stream. It will be advantageous to maintain the firm correctness of the superior man.

> ䷌ describes a condition of nature and of the state opposite to that of ䷋. There was distress and obstruction; here is union. But the union must be based entirely on public considerations, without taint of selfishness.

> The strong line in the fifth, its correct, place, occupies the most important position, and has for its correlate the weak second line, also in its correct place. The one divided line is naturally sought after by all the strong lines. The upper trigram ☰ is that of heaven, which is above; the lower is that of fire, whose tendency is to mount upwards. All these things are in harmony with the idea of union. But the union must be free from all selfish motives, and this is indicated by its being in the remote districts of the country, where people are unsophisticated, and free from the depraving effects incident to large societies. A union from such motives will cope with the greatest difficulties; and yet a word of caution is added.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷌ the weak line has the place of influence, the central place, and responds to the corresponding line in ☰ above; hence comes its name of ䷌ or Union of men.
2. The language, ䷌ appears here as we find it in the remote districts of the country, indicating progress and success, and that it will be advantageous to cross the great stream, is moulded by its containing the strength symbolled in ☰. Then we have the trigram indicating elegance and intelligence, supported by that indicating strength; with the line in the central, and its correct, position, and responding to the corresponding line above; all representing the correct course of the superior man. It is only the superior man who can comprehend and affect the minds of all under the sky.

> The proper correlate of line 2 is line 5, and it responds to the corresponding line in ☰, the idea of union.
The ䷌ says is merely a careless repetition of the three concluding characters.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigrams ☰ for heaven and ☲ fire form ䷌. The superior man, in accordance with this, distinguishes things according to their kinds and classes.

> The style of heaven and fire form ䷌ is such as to suggest the appearance of fire ascending up, blazing to the sky, and uniting with it.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, undivided, shows the representative of the union of men just issuing from his gate. There will be no error.

> The representative of the union of men is just issuing from his gate; who will blame him?

> Line 1 emblems the first attempts at union. It is strong, but in the lowest place; and it has no proper correlate above. There is, however, no intermixture of selfishness in it. In line 1, the party just issuing from his gate has all the world before him, with which to unite. Selfish thoughts disposing to union have no place in him.

2. The second line, divided, shows the representative of the union of men in relation with his kindred. There will be occasion for regret.

> The representative of the union of men appears in relation with his kindred; that is the path to regret.

> Lines 2 and 5 are proper correlates, which fact suggests in this hexagram the idea of their union being limited and partial, and such as may afford ground for blame. In line 2, union only with kindred implies narrowness of mind.

3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject with his arms hidden in the thick grass, and at the top of a high mound. But for three years he makes no demonstration.

> He hides his arms in the thick grass; because of the strength of his opponent. For three years he makes no demonstration; how can he do anything?

> Line 3 is strong, and in an odd place; but it has not a proper correlate in 6. This makes its subject more anxious to unite with 2; but 2 is devoted to its proper correlate in 5, of whose strength 3 is afraid, and takes the measures described. His abstaining so long, however, from any active attempt, will save him from misfortune.

4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject mounted on the city wall; but he does not proceed to make the attack he contemplates. There will be good fortune.

> He is mounted on his city-wall; but yielding to the right, he does not proceed to make the attack he contemplated. Where it is said, There will be good fortune, that shows how he feels the strait he is in, and returns to the rule of law.

> Line 4 is strong, but in an even place, which weakens its subject, He also would fain make an attempt on 2; but he is afraid, and does not carry his purpose into effect. In line 4, stress should be laid on yielding to the right.

5. In the fifth line, undivided, the representative of the union of men first wails and cries out, and then laughs. His great host conquers, and he and the subject of the second line meet together.

> The first action of the representative of the union of men here described arises from his central position and straightforward character. The meeting secured by his great host intimates that the opponents of it have been overcome.

> Line 5 is strong, in an odd, and the central place; and would fain unite with 2, which indeed is the proper correlate of its subject. But 3 and 4 are powerful foes that oppose the union, Their opposition makes him weep; but he collects his forces, defeats them, and effects his purpose. The representative of the union of men first cries out and weeps, and afterwards laughs.

```
The ways of good men (different seem).
This in a public office toils;
That in his home the time beguiles.
One man his lips with silence seals;
Another all his mind reveals.
But when two men are one in heart,
Not iron bolts keep them apart;
The words they in their union use,
Fragrance like orchid plants diffuse.'
```

6. The topmost line, undivided, shows the representative of the union of men in the suburbs. There will be no occasion for repentance.

> The representative of the union of men appears in the suburbs; his object has not yet been attained.

> The union reaches to all within the suburbs, and is not yet universal; but still there is no cause for repentance. Under line 1 it is said that union in the open country indicates progress and success, while here it is only said that with union in the suburbs there is no cause for repentance. Beyond the suburbs was the open country, and till the union reached so far, the object of the hexagram was not attained.
