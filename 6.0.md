## JUDGMENT

䷒ indicates that under the conditions supposed in it there will be great progress and success, while it will be advantageous to be firmly correct. In the eighth month there will be evil.

> ䷒ is explained as meaning great. The writer, having misunderstood the meaning of the previous ䷑, subjoins; He who performs such services may become great. But ䷒ denotes the approach of authority, to inspect, to comfort, or to rule. When we look at the figure, we see two strong undivided lines advancing on the four weak lines above them, and thence follows the assurance that their action will be powerful and successful. That action must be governed by rectitude, however, and by caution grounded on the changing character of all conditions and events. The meaning of the concluding sentence is given in the comments below as simply being that, the advancing power will decay in no long time. The sun or the day is the symbol of what is strong; and the moon is the symbol of what is weak. Eight is the number of the second of the four emblematic figures (⚍), and seven is the number of the third of them (⚎). Hence to indicate the period of the coming of what is dark, we use the phrase, the eighth month; and to indicate the period of the coming of what is bright, we use the phrase, the seventh day. The strong numbers culminate in 9, the influence then receding and producing the 8 of the ⚍. The weak numbers culminate in 6, and the next advance produces the 7 of the ⚎; so that 7 and 8 are the numbers indicating the first birth of what is weak and what is strong. ䷒ is the hexagram of the twelfth month.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷒ we see the strong lines gradually increasing and advancing.
2. The lower trigram ☱ is the symbol of being pleased, and the upper ☷ of being compliant. The strong line is in the central position, and is properly responded to.
3. There is great progress and success, along with firm correctness; this is the way of Heaven.
4. In the eighth month there will be evil; the advancing power will decay after no long time.

> See what has been said on the fourth line, below.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☱ for the waters of a marsh and ☷ that for the earth above it form ䷒. The superior man, in accordance with this, has his purposes of instruction that are inexhaustible, and nourishes and supports the people without limit.

> The earth descending or approaching the marsh is, symbolical of the approach of superiors to the inferior people, and then the two predicates about the superior man are descriptive of him in that approach, the instruction being symbolised by ☱, and the supporting by ☷. ䷒ means great. The earth above the waters of the marsh shows how full those waters are, rising to the level of the earth, and thus expressing the idea of greatness. This representation is lame and impotent.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject advancing in company with the subject of the second line. Through his firm correctness there will be good fortune.

> The good fortune through the firm correctness of the subject of the first line advancing in company with the subject of the second is due to his will being set on doing what is right.

> Line 1 is a strong line in its proper place. The danger is that its subject may be more strong than prudent, hence the caution in requiring firm correctness.

2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject advancing in company with the subject of the first line. There will be good fortune; advancing will be in every way advantageous.

> The good fortune and every possible advantage attending the advance of the subject of the second line, in company with the subject of the first, arises from the fact that those to whom the advance is made are not yet obedient to the ordinances of Heaven.

> Line 2, as strong, should be in an odd place; but this is more than counterbalanced by the central position, and its correlate in line 5. 

3. The third line, divided, shows one well pleased indeed to advance, but whose action will be in no way advantageous. If he become anxious about it however, there will be no error.

> He shows himself well pleased to advance; his position is not that appropriate to him. If he become anxious, however, about his action, his error will not be continued.

> Line 3 is weak, and neither central, nor in its correct position. Hence its action will not be advantageous; but being at the top of the trigram ☱, which means being pleased, its subject is represented as well pleased to advance. Anxious reflection will save him from error.

4. The fourth line, divided, shows one advancing in the highest mode. There will be no error.

> The freedom from error consequent on the advance in the highest mode is due to the various appropriateness of the position.

> Line 4, though weak, is in its proper place, and has for its correlate the strong 1. Hence its advance is in the highest style.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows the advance of wisdom, such as befits the great ruler. There will be good fortune.

> What befits the great ruler means the pursuing the course of the due mean.

> Line 5 is the position of the ruler. It is weak, but being central, and having for its correlate the strong and central 2, we have in it a symbol of authority distrustful of itself, and employing fit agents; characteristic of the wise ruler.

6. The sixth line, divided, shows the advance of honesty and generosity. There will be good fortune, and no error.

> The good fortune consequent on the advance of honesty and generosity is due to the will of the subject of the line being set on the subjects of the first two lines of the inner trigram ☱.

> Line 6 is the last of the trigram ☷, the height therefore of docility. Line 2 is not its correlate, but it belongs to the weak to seek for the strong; and it is so emphatically in this case.
