# ䷡ [Strength] ☰∞☳

## JUDGMENT

䷡ indicates that (under the conditions which it symbolises) it will be advantageous to be firm and correct.

> The strong lines predominate in ䷡. It suggested to king a state or condition of things in which there was abundance of strength and vigour. Was strength alone enough for the conduct of affairs? No. He saw also in the figure that which suggested to him that strength should be held in subordination to the idea of right, and exerted only in harmony with it.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷡ we see that which is great becoming strong. We have the trigram denoting strength directing that which denotes movement, and hence the whole is expressive of vigour.
2. ䷡ indicates that it will be advantageous to be firm and correct; that which is great should be correct. Given correctness and greatness in their highest degree, and the character and tendencies of heaven and earth can be seen.

> That which is great denotes, in the first place, the group of four strong lines which strikes us on looking at the figure, and then the superior man, or the strong men in positions of power, of whom these are the representatives. ☰ is the trigram of strength, and ☳ that of movement.

> That which is great should be correct; that the should be must be supplied in the translation appears from this, that the paragraph is intended to illustrate the text that it will be advantageous to be firm and correct. The power of man becomes then a reflexion of the great power which we see working in nature, impartially, unselfishly.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☰ representing heaven and above it ☳ that for thunder form ䷡. The superior man, in accordance with this, does not take a step which is not according to propriety.

> In illustration of the symbolism of the trigrams here, Thunder rolling above in the sky and making all things shake is the emblem of great power. In passing on to its application he starts with a beautiful saying of antiquity, that the strong man is he who overcomes himself. That this thought was in the mind of the writer of the paragraph on the symbolism I can well believe; but the analogy between the natural and the moral and spiritual worlds in passing from the phenomenon of thunder to this truth is a thing to be felt, and that can hardly be described.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject manifesting his strength in his toes. But advance will lead to evil, most certainly.

> He manifests his vigour in his toes; this will certainly lead to exhaustion.

> Line 1 is strong, in its correct place, and also the first line in ☰, the hexagram of strength, and the first line in ䷡. The idea of the figure might seem to be concentrated in it; and hence we have it symbolised by strength in the toes, or advancing. But such a measure is too bold to be undertaken by one in the lowest place, and moreover there is no proper correlate in 4. Hence comes the evil auspice. This will lead to exhaustion; and from that will follow distress and other evils.

2. The second line, undivided, shows that with firm correctness there will be good fortune.

> This is due to its being in the centre, and its subject exemplifying the due mean.

> Line 2 is strong, but the strength is tempered by its being in an even place, instead of being excited by it, as might be feared. Then the place is that in the centre. With firm correctness there will be good fortune. The central position and the due moral mean is another instance of the felt analogy referred to above.

3. The third line, undivided, shows, in the case of a small man, one using all his strength; and in the case of a superior man, one whose rule is not to do so. Even with firm correctness the position would be perilous. The exercise of strength in it might be compared to the case of a ram butting against a fence, and getting his horns entangled.

> The small man uses all his strength; in the case of the superior man it is his rule not to do so.

> Line 3 is strong, and in its proper place. It is at the top moreover of ☰. A small man so symbolled will use his strength to the utmost; but not so the superior man. For him the position is beyond the safe middle, and he will be cautious; and not injure himself, like the ram, by exerting his strength.

4. The fourth line, undivided, shows a case in which firm correctness leads to good fortune, and occasion for repentance disappears. We see the fence opened without the horns being entangled. The strength is like that in the wheel-spokes of a large waggon.

> The fence is opened and the horns are not entangled; the subject of the line still advances.

> Line 4 is still strong, but in the place of a weak line; and this gives occasion to the cautions with which the symbolism commences. The subject of the line going forward thus cautiously, his strength will produce good effects, such as are described.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows one who loses his ram-like strength in the ease of his position. But there will be no occasion for repentance.

> He loses his ram and hardly perceives it; he is not in his appropriate place.

> Line 5 is weak, and occupies a central place. Its subject will cease therefore to exert his strength; but this hexagram does not forbid the employment of strength, but would only control and direct it. All that is said about him is that he will give no occasion for repentance. He is not in his appropriate place; this is said simply because an odd place ought to be filled by a strong line.

6. The sixth line, divided, shows one who may be compared to the ram butting against the fence, and unable either to retreat, or to advance as he would fain do. There will not be advantage in any respect; but if he realise the difficulty of his position, there will be good fortune.

> He is unable either to retreat or to advance; this is owing to his want of care. If he realise the difficulty of his position, there will be good fortune; his error will not be prolonged.

> Line 6 being at the top of ☳, the symbol of movement, and at the top of ䷡, its subject may be expected to be active in exerting his strength; and through his weakness, the result would be as described. But he becomes conscious of his weakness, reflects and rests, and good fortune results, as he desists from the prosecution of his unwise efforts.
