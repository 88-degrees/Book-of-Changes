# ䷍ [Great Havings] ☰∞☲

## 111.101

## JUDGMENT

䷍ indicates that, under the circumstances which it implies, there will be great progress and success.

> ䷍ means Great Havings; denoting in a kingdom a state of prosperity and abundance, and in a, family or individual, a state of opulence. The danger threatening such a condition arises from the pride which it is likely to engender. But everything here is against that issue. Apart from the symbolism of the trigrams, we have the place of honour occupied by a weak line, so that its subject will be humble; and all the other lines, strong as they are, will act in obedient sympathy. There will be great progress and success.

### COMMENTS

1. In ䷍ the weak line has the place of honour, is grandly central, and the strong lines above and below respond to it. Hence comes its name of ䷍ Having what is Great.
2. The attributes of its component trigrams are strength and vigour with elegance and brightness. The ruling line in it responds to the ruling line in the symbol of heaven, and consequently its action is all at the proper times. In this way it is said to indicate great progress and success.

> The position in the fifth place indicates the dignity, and its being central, in the centre of the upper trigram ☲, indicates the virtue, of the lord of the figure. The strength of the lord, moreover, is directed by intelligence and his actions are always at the proper time, like the seasons of heaven.

### SYMBOLISM

The trigram ☰ for heaven and ☲ that of fire above it form ䷍. The superior man, in accordance with this, represses what is evil and gives distinction to what is good, in sympathy with the excellent Heaven-conferred nature.

> Fire above the sky will shine far; and this is supposed to symbolise the vastness of the territory or of the wealth implied in the possession of what is great. The superior man, in governing men, especially in a time of prosperity and wealth, must set himself to develope what is good in them, and repress what is evil. And this will be in accordance with the will of Heaven, which has given to all men a nature fitted for goodness.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. In the first line, undivided, there is no approach to what is injurious, and there is no error. Let there be a realisation of the difficulty and danger of the position, and there will be no error to the end.

> This first line, undivided,of ䷍ shows no approach to what is injurious.

> Line 1, though strong, is at the lowest part of the figure, and has no correlate above. No external influences have as yet acted injuriously on its subject. Let him do as directed, and no hurtful influence will ever affect him.

2. In the second line, undivided, we have a large waggon with its load. In whatever direction advance is made, there will be no error.

> A large waggon with its load refers to the virtue accumulated in the subject of the line, so that he will suffer no loss in the conduct of affairs.

> The strong line 2 has its proper correlate in line 5, the ruler of the figure, and will use its strength in subordination to his humility. Hence the symbolism.

3. The third line, undivided, shows us a feudal prince presenting his offerings to the Son of Heaven. A small man would be unequal to such a duty.

> A feudal prince presents his offerings to the son of Heaven; a small man in such a position does himself harm.

> Line 3 is strong, and in the right an odd place. The topmost line of the lower trigram is the proper place for a feudal lord. The subject of this will humbly serve the condescending ruler in line 5. A small man, having the place without the virtue, would give himself airs.

4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject keeping his great resources under restraint. There will be no error.

> He keeps his great resources under restraint; his wisdom discriminates clearly what he ought to do.

> Line 4 is strong, but the strength is tempered by the position, which is that of a weak line. Hence he will do no injury to the mild ruler, to whom he is so near.

5. The fifth line, divided, shows the sincerity of its subject reciprocated by that of all the others represented in the hexagram. Let him display a proper majesty, and there will be good fortune.

> His sincerity is reciprocated by all the others; his sincerity serves to stir and call out what is in their minds. The good fortune springing from a display of proper majesty shows how they might otherwise feel too easy, and make no preparation to serve him.

> Line 5 symbolises the ruler. Mild sincerity is good in him, and affects his ministers and others. But a ruler must not be without an awe-inspiring majesty.

6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subject with help accorded to him from Heaven. There will be good fortune, advantage in every respect.

> The good fortune attached to the topmost line of ䷍ arises from the help of Heaven.

> Even the topmost line takes its character from 5. The strength of its subject is still tempered, and Heaven gives its approval.
