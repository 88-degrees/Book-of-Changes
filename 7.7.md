## JUDGMENT

䷀ represents what is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and firm.

> We ascribe four attributes here to ䷀, corresponding to the principles of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and knowledge in man's nature. Or we assigne only two, and that we should translate, greatly penetrating, and requires to be correct and firm, two responses in divination.

> The dragon is the symbol employed by the duke to represent the superior man and especially the great man, exhibiting the virtues or attributes characteristic of heaven. The creature's proper home is in the water, but it can disport itself on the land, and also fly and soar aloft. It has been from the earliest time the emblem with the man of the highest dignity and wisdom, of sovereignty and sagehood, the combination of which constitutes the great man. One emblem runs through the lines of many of the hexagrams as here.

### COMMENTS

1. Vast is the great and originating power indicated by ䷀. All things owe to it their beginning; it contains all the meaning belonging to the name heaven.
2. The clouds move and the rain is distributed; the various things appear in their developed forms.
3. The sages grandly understand the connexion between the end and the beginning, and how the indications of the six lines in the hexagram are accomplished, each in its season. Accordingly they mount the carriage drawn by those six dragons at the proper times, and drive through the sky.
4. The method of ䷀ is to change and transform, so that everything obtains its correct nature as appointed by the mind of Heaven; and thereafter the conditions of great harmony are preserved in union. The result is what is advantageous, and correct and firm.
5. The sage appears aloft, high above all things, and the myriad states all enjoy repose.

> The hexagram ䷀ is made up of six undivided lines, or of the trigram ☰, the symbol for heaven, repeated. The judgment does not dwell upon this, but starts, in its exposition, from the word heaven, supposing that the hexagram represented all the meaning which had ever been intended by that term.

> In line 3 and 5, the subject is the sage. When the meaning necessitates the presence of a human agent, who rules in the world of men as heaven does in that of nature. The connexion between the end and the beginning, which he sees, is that of cause and effect in the operations of nature and the course of human affairs. The various steps in that course are symbolised by the lines of the hexagram; and the ideal sage, conducting his ideal government, taking his measures accordingly, is represented as driving through the sky in a carriage drawn by six dragons. The sage is Heaven, and Heaven is the sage; but there is nothing like this in the text.

### EXPLANATION

1. What is called under ䷀ the great and originating is in man the first and chief quality of goodness; what is called the penetrating is the assemblage of excellences; what is called the advantageous is the harmony of all that is right; and what is called the correct and firm is the faculty of action.
2. The superior man, embodying benevolence, is fit to preside over men; presenting the assemblage of excellences, he is fit to show in himself the union of all propriety; benefiting all creatures, he is fit to exhibit the harmony of all that is right; correct and firm, he is fit to manage all affairs.
3. The fact that the superior man practises these four virtues justifies the application to him of the words. ䷀ represents what is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and firm.

> The attributes of ䷀, are to be understood of the constituent principles of human nature. The ascription of the four virtues to the superior-or normal man, man in his best estate, and yet inferior to the sagely man.

> The greatness and originating represented by ䷀ refer to it as the symbol of what gives their beginning to all things, and also secures their growth and development. The advantageousness and the correctness and firmness refer to its nature and feelings as seen in all the resulting things.

> ䷀, thus originating, is able with its admirable benefits to benefit all under the sky. How great is what is emblemed by ䷀; strong, vigorous, undeflected, correct, and in all these qualities pure, unmixed, exquisite.

> The six lines, bring forth and display its meaning, and everything about it is thus indirectly exhibited. The great man at the proper time drives with these six dragons through the sky. The clouds move, and the rain is distributed; all under heaven enjoys repose.

> The originating power cannot be separated from that of penetration and development. The latter issues from the former as the summer follows on the spring. The advantageousness and firm correctness, he compares also to the autumn and winter, saying that the ䷀ power in its essence, as it is in itself, is best described by these two latter characteristics, while the two former describe it in its operation. Like the clouds and the rain to the thirsty earth, so is the rule of the sage to expectant humanity.

### SYMBOLISM

Heaven, in its motion, gives the idea of strength. The superior man, in accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity.

> ䷀ is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name. In the case of other hexagrams of similar formation, the repetition of the trigram is pointed out. That is not done here, because there is but one heaven. But the motion of heaven is a complete revolution every day, resumed again the next; so moves the unwearied sun from day to day, making it a good symbol of renewed, untiring effort.

### LINE STATEMENTS

1. In the first or lowest line, undivided, we see its subject as the dragon lying hid in the deep. It is not the time for active doing.

> The dragon lies hid in the deep; it is not the time for active doing? There he is, with the powers of the dragon, and yet lying hid. The influence of the world would make no change in him; he would do nothing merely to secure his fame. He can live, withdrawn from the world, without regret; he can experience disapproval without trouble of mind. Rejoicing in opportunity, he carries his principles into action; sorrowing for want of opportunity, he keeps with them in retirement. Yes, he is not to be torn from his root in himself. This is the dragon lying hid.

> The dragon lies hid; it is not the time for active doing; the position is too low.

> The dragon lies hid in the deep; it is not the time for active doing; the energy denoted by the undivided line is laid up and hid away as in the deep.

> Time and circumstances are essential, as well as inward power, to successful development and demonstration.

> In the superior man his conduct is the fruit of his perfected virtue, which might be seen therefore in his daily course; but the force of that phrase, lying hid, requires him to keep retired, and not yet show himself, nor proceed to the full development of his course. While this is the case, the superior man knows that it is not the time for active doing. The subject has the virtue; but his position in the lowest place shows that his time is not yet come.

2. In the second line, undivided, we see its subject as the dragon appearing in the field. It will be advantageous to meet with the great man.

> The dragon appears in the field; the diffusion of virtuous influence has been wide.

> The dragon shows himself and is in the field; it will be advantageous to see the great man? There he is, with the dragon's powers, and occupying exactly the central place. He is sincere even in his ordinary words, and earnest in his ordinary conduct. Guarding against depravity, he preserves his sincerity. His goodness is recognised in the world, but he does not boast of it. His virtue is extensively displayed, and transformation ensues. It refers to a ruler's virtue.

> The line, a strong or undivided line, and therefore strong, is said to be exactly in the central place; but the line is in the second, an even place, that proper to a weak line; and in other passages this might be explained in an unfavourable way.

> The dragon shows himself and is in the field; the time requires him still to be unemployed.

> The dragon appears in the field; all under heaven begins to be adorned and brightened.

> The superior man learns and accumulates the results of his learning; puts questions, and discriminates among those results; dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he has attained to; and carries it into practice with benevolence.

> We have the superior man developing, by means of the processes described, into the great man, with the attributes of a ruler, the appearance of whom is a blessing to men.

3. In the third line, undivided, we see its subject as the superior man active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening still careful and apprehensive. The position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake.

> Active and vigilant all the day; this refers to the treading of the proper path over and over again.

> The superior man is active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening still careful and apprehensive; the position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake? The superior man advances in virtue, and cultivates all the sphere of his duty. His loyal-heartedness and good faith are the way by which he advances in virtue. His attention to his words and establishing his sincerity are the way by which he occupies in his sphere. He knows the utmost point to be reached, and reaches it, thus showing himself in accord with the first springs of things; he knows the end to be rested in, and rests in it, thus preserving his righteousness in accordance with that end. Therefore he occupies a high position without pride, and a low position without anxiety. Thus it is that, being active and vigilant, and careful also and apprehensive as the time requires, though his position be perilous, he will make no mistake.

> All the day active and vigilant; he now does his proper business. Continually, as the time passes and requires, does he act.

> In the third line, there is a twofold symbol of strength, but the position is not central. Its occupant is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath. Therefore there must be active vigilance and cautious apprehension as the time requires; and. though the position be perilous, there will be no mistake.

> The twofold symbol of strength is the strong or undivided line in the third place odd proper to it. There will be no mistake, because the subject of the line, in the exercise of his caution, will abstain from any forward movement.

4. In the fourth line, undivided, we see its subject as the dragon looking as if he were leaping up, but still in the deep. There will be no mistake.

> He seems to be leaping up, but is still in the deep; if he advance, there will be no error. He finds no permanent place either above or below, but he does not commit the error of advancing. He may advance or recede; there is no permanent place for him: but he does not leave his fellows. The superior man, advancing in virtue and cultivating the sphere of his duty, yet wishes to advance only at the proper time, and therefore there is no mistake.

> He is as if he were leaping up, but still is in the deep; he is making trial of himself. A change is taking place in the method indicated by this ䷀ diagram.

> The subject passes here from the lower trigram ☰ and enters into the upper ☰. We are told not to lay stress on the method of ䷀. We have the sage upon the throne. Time and opportunity are both in progress, they are both passed, have reached their extremity or end.

> In the fourth line, there is the symbol of strength, but the position is not central. Its occupant is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath, nor is he in the place of man intermediate. Hence he is in perplexity; and being so, he has doubts about what should be his movements, and so will give no occasion for blame.

> Both the third and fourth lines in the hexagram belong to man, and are intermediate between those of heaven and those of earth. To get over the difficulty in what is said on the fourth line, as a matter of fact and locally, man is nearer earth than heaven, and is aptly represented therefore by the third line and not by the fourth.

5. In the fifth line, undivided, we see its subject as the dragon on the wing in the sky. It will be advantageous to meet with the great man.

> The dragon is on the wing in the sky; the great man rouses himself to his work.

> Notes of the same key respond to one another; creatures of the same nature seek one another; water flows towards the place that is low and damp; fire rises up towards what is dry; clouds follow the dragon, and winds follow the tiger: so the sage makes his appearance, and all men look to him. Things that draw their origin from heaven move towards what is above; things that draw their origin from the earth cleave to what is below: so does everything follow its kind.

> The fifth is almost always the place of honour and authority in the hexagram, and therefore the great man here continues to be the great man, the sage. The argument is that as things of the same kind respond to and seek one another, so is it with the sage and ordinary man. They are of the same kind, though far apart; and when a sage appears, all other men look to him with admiration and hope. The continuity of the illustrations, however, is broken by the introduction of the dragon and clouds, and the tiger and wind. The dragon feels the influence of the clouds surcharged with rain, and rises from the deep, and when the tiger feels the approach of the cold winds he roars. Thus when the dragon rises, the clouds are sure to collect; and when the tiger screams, the winds follow, but all this does not help us to appreciate any better the words of the text. And the concluding illustration is nearly as foreign to our way of conceiving things. By things that draw their origin from heaven all animals, moving creatures, are intended; and by those that draw their origin from the earth are intended all plants,—things that stand and do not move. The former turn their heads to the sky, and the latter their roots to the earth.

> The dragon is on the wing in the sky; the subject of the line is on high and ruling.

> The dragon is on the wing in the sky; this shows that his place is based on his heavenly virtue.

> The great man is he who is in harmony, in his attributes, with heaven and earth; in his brightness, with the sun and moon; in his orderly procedure, with the four sea-sons; and in his relation to what is fortunate and what is calamitous, in harmony with the spirit-like operations of Providence. He may precede Heaven, and Heaven will not act in opposition to him; he may follow Heaven, but will act only as Heaven at the time would do. If Heaven will not act in opposition to him, how much less will men. how much less will the spirit-like operation of Providence.

6. In the sixth or topmost line, undivided, we see its subject as the dragon exceeding the proper limits. There will be occasion for repentance.

> But the dragon appears in the sixth line as going beyond the proper limits. The ruling-sage has gone through all the sphere in which he is called on to display his attributes; it is time for him to relax. The line should not be always pulled tight; the bow should not be always kept drawn. The unchanging use of force will give occasion for repentance. The moral meaning found in the line is that the high shall be abased.

> The dragon exceeds the proper limits; there will be occasion for repentance; a state of fullness, that is, should not be indulged in long.

> He is noble, but is not in his correct place; he is on high, but there are no people to acknowledge him; there is a man of virtue and ability below, but he will not assist him. Hence whatever movement he may make will give occasion for repentance.

> The position is noble, but it is not that of office; its occupant dwells on high, but he has no people to rule; and the men of talent and virtue in the positions below will give him no aid; should he move in such a case, there will be occasion for repentance.

> The place of honour and authority in the hexagram belongs to the fifth line, and no other plays so unimportant a part as the sixth; and hence it is represented here as having no place at all. Before he whom it represents is called to act, the battle has been won or lost. Movement from him will only accelerate and intensify the result.

> The dragon exceeds the proper limit, and there will be occasion for repentance; when things have been carried to extremity, calamity ensues. The time is come to an end, and so also is his opportunity. The knowing to advance but not to retire; to maintain but not to let perish to get but not to lose.

> He only is the sage who knows to advance and to retire, to maintain and to let perish; and that without ever acting incorrectly. Yes, he only is the sage.

> The lines of this hexagram are all strong and undivided. If the host of dragons thus appearing were to divest themselves of their heads, there would be good fortune.


> The host of dragons without their heads would give us the hexagram ䷁, made up of six divided lines. Force would have given place to submission, and haughtiness to humility; and the result would be good fortune. The same line undivided is used in all the places of this hexagram, but the attribute of heaven thereby denoted should not always take the foremost place. Undivided lines appear in all these representations of the great and originating power denoted by ䷀; all under the sky there will be good order.

> Undivided lines appear in all these representations of the great and originating power denoted by ䷀; and we see the model of action afforded by heaven. The model of heaven, is the due blending of the strong and active with the weak and passive, the regulation of movement in accordance with the highest reason, so that there shall be neither excess nor deficiency.
