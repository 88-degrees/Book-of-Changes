<p><code>1-3</code> When there were heaven and earth, then afterwards all things were produced. What fills up (the space) between heaven and earth are (those) all things.

<h6 id="p436">p. 436</h6>
<p>husband and wife there came father and son. From father and son there came ruler and minister. From ruler and minister there came high and low. When (the distinction of) high and low had existence, afterwards came the arrangements of propriety and righteousness.</p>
<p>The rule for the relation of husband and wife is that it should be long-enduring. Hence <a href="e592b8xian.md.html"><strong>Xián ䷞</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e68192heng.md.html"><strong>Héng ䷟</strong></a>. <a href="e68192heng.md.html"><strong>Héng ䷟</strong></a> denotes long enduring.<a name="fr_307"></a><sub><a href="#fn_304">7</a></sub></p>

Things cannot be for ever withdrawn; and hence Thun is succeeded by <a href="e5a4a7e5a3aedazhuang.md.html"><strong>Dà Zhuàng ䷡</strong></a>. Things cannot remain forever (simply) in the state of vigour; and hence <a href="e5a4a7e5a3aedazhuang.md.html"><strong>Dà Zhuàng ䷡</strong></a> is succeeded by <a href="e6998bjin.md.html"><strong>Jìn ䷢</strong></a>. <a href="e6998bjin.md.html"><strong>Jìn ䷢</strong></a> denotes advancing.

<p><code>40-44</code> In a state of relaxation and ease there are sure to be losses; and hence <a href="e8a7a3xie.md.html"><strong>Xiè ䷧</strong></a> is followed</p>

But when <a href="e68d9fsun.md.html"><strong>Sǔn ䷨</strong></a> (or diminution) is going on without end, increase is sure to come. <a href="e68d9fsun.md.html"><strong>Sǔn ䷨</strong></a> therefore is followed by <a href="e79b8ayi.md.html"><strong>Yì ䷩</strong></a>.

Hence <a href="e5a4acguai.md.html"><strong>Guài ䷪</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e5a7a4gou.md.html"><strong>Gòu ䷫</strong></a>, which denotes such meeting.</p>
<p><code>44-48</code> When things meet together, a collection is then formed. Hence <a href="e5a7a4gou.md.html"><strong>Gòu ䷫</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e89083cui.md.html"><strong>Cuì ䷬</strong></a>, which name denotes, being collected. When (good men) are collected and mount to the highest places, there results what we call an upward advance; and hence <a href="e89083cui.md.html"><strong>Cuì ䷬</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e58d87sheng.md.html"><strong>Shēng ䷭</strong></a>. When such advance continues without stopping, there is sure to come distress; and hence <a href="e58d87sheng.md.html"><strong>Shēng ䷭</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e59bb0kun.md.html"><strong>Kùn ䷮</strong></a>.

<p><code>48,49</code> What happens under <a href="e4ba95jing.md.html"><strong>Jǐng ䷯</strong></a> requires to be changed, and hence it is followed by <a href="e99da9ge.md.html"><strong>Gé ䷰</strong></a> (denoting change).</p>

But things cannot be kept in motion forever. The motion is stopped; and hence <a href="e99c87zhen.md.html"><strong>Zhèn ䷲</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e889aegen.md.html"><strong>Gèn ䷳</strong></a>, which gives the idea of arresting or stopping. Things cannot be kept for ever in a state of repression, and hence <a href="e889aegen.md.html"><strong>Gèn ䷳</strong></a> is followed by <a href="e6b890jian.md.html"><strong>Jiàn ䷴</strong></a>, which gives the idea of</p>

When things thus find the proper point to which to come, they are sure to become great. Hence <a href="e5bd92e5a6b9guimei.md.html"><strong>Guī Mèi ䷵</strong></a> is succeeded by <a href="e4b8b0feng.md.html"><strong>Fēng ䷶</strong></a>, which conveys the idea of being great.</p>

When men have the belief which <a href="e4b8ade5ad9azhongfu.md.html"><strong>Zhōng Fú ䷼</strong></a> implies, they are sure to carry it into practice; and hence it is succeeded by <a href="e5b08fe8bf87xiaoguo.md.html"><strong>Xiǎo Guò ䷽</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p><a name="fn_297"></a><a href="#fr_297">439:a</a> The few sentences on this Appendix in the Introduction are sufficient. It shows the importance of the meaning of the name in an attempt to explain the lineal figures, and prepares us to expect on each one a brief enigmatical essay, which, it has been seen, is the nature of the Text. But the writer, whoever he was, is by no means careful always to follow that Text in the significance of the characters, as will appear in the few instances to which attention is called in the following notices. The treatise is too slight to require, or to justify, an exhibition of all its inaccuracies.</p>
<p><a name="fn_298"></a><a href="#fr_298">439:1</a> But <a href="e5b1afzhun.md.html"><strong>Zhūn ䷂</strong></a> does not denote filling up. It is the symbol of being in a state of distress and difficulty. The writer is thinking of the result of the interaction of heaven and earth as being to fill all between them with the various forms of living beings; and to represent that he gives the result of <a href="e5b1afzhun.md.html"><strong>Zhūn ䷂</strong></a>, and not its meaning. He makes a blunder which might have been easily avoided, for he adds immediately that the character is descriptive of things on their first production.</p>
<p><a name="fn_299"></a><a href="#fr_300">439:2</a> It is difficult to follow the writer here. <a href="e99c80xu.md.html"><strong>Xū ䷄</strong></a> in the Text is the symbol of the idea of waiting. Does he mean that a provision of food and drink can only be made gradually? There is nothing in the character <a href="e99c80xu.md.html"><strong>Xū ䷄</strong></a> to awaken in the mind the idea of nourishment, Then the genesis of contention which is given is strange. The writer probably had in his mind the lines of the <a href="https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&id=15357">Shih, II, i, ode 5. 3</a>: --</p>
<pre><code>'The loss of kindly feeling oft
From slightest things shall grow.
Where all the fare is dry and spare,
Resentments fierce may glow.'

<p>But what is allowable, good even, in poetry, is out of place in this treatise.</p>
<p><a name="fn_300"></a><a href="#fr_302">439:3</a> Contention on a great scale will put all the population of a state in excitement and motion, and military measures of repression will be necessary. But the idea of the multitudes in <a href="e5b888shi.md.html"><strong>Shī ䷆</strong></a> would seem to be simply that of number, and not that of a numerous host. In a feudal kingdom, however, all the able-bodied people might be required to join the army.</p>

It seems here to be derived from the homophonous lî, the symbol of acts of ceremony. The identity of sound or name must be considered as accidental. A measured step would be one of the first ways in which the inward sense of propriety would manifest itself.</p>
