# APPENDIX VII

Treatise on the Hexagrams taken promiscuously, according to the opposition or diversity of their meaning.

This last of the Appendixes is touched on very briefly in the concluding paragraph of the Introduction. It is stated there to be in rhyme, and I have endeavoured to give a similar form to the following version of it. The rhymes and length of the lines in the original, however, are very irregular, and I found it impossible to reproduce that irregularity in English.

- `19, 20` [**Lín ䷒**](e4b8b4lin.md) gives, [**Guān ䷓**](e8a782guan.md) seeks; -- such are the several themes Their different figures were to teach designed.

- `3` [**Zhūn ䷂**](e5b1afzhun.md) manifests itself, yet keeps its place;

- `25` [**Wú Wàng ䷘**](e697a0e5a684wuwang.md) sets forth how evil springs from crime.
