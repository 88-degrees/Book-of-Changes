# APPENDIX VIII

<a id="p-36"/>

We proceed to the second Appendix, which professes to do for the [duke of Zhōu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Zhou)'s symbolical exposition of the several lines what the `Tuàn Zhuàn`([彖传](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/tuan-zhuan)) does for the entire figures. The work here, however, is accomplished with less trouble and more briefly. The whole bears the name of `Xiàng Zhuàn`([象传](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/xiang-zhuan)), 'Treatise on the Symbols' or 'Treatise on the Symbolism (of the `Yì Jīng`([易经](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/yi-jing))).' If there were reason to think that it came in any way from Confucius, I should fancy that I saw him sitting with a select class of his disciples around him. They read the [duke]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Zhou))'s Text column after column, and the master drops now a word or two, and now a sentence or two, that illuminate the meaning. The disciples take notes on their tablets, or store his remarks in their memories, and by and by they write them out with the whole of the, Text or only so much of it as is necessary. Whoever was the original lecturer, the Appendix, I think, must have grown up in this way.

It would not be necessary to speak of it at greater length, if it were not that the six paragraphs on the symbols of the duke of Kâu are always preceded by one which is called '[the Great Symbolism](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/xiang-zhuan),' and treats of the trigrams composing the hexagram, how they go together to form the six-lined figure, and how their blended meaning appears in the institutions and proceedings of the great men and kings of former days, and of the superior men of all time. The paragraph is for the most part, but by no means always, in harmony with the explanation of the hexagram by [king Wén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou), and a place in the `Tuàn Zhuàn`([彖传](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/tuan-zhuan)) would be more appropriate to it. I suppose that, because it always begins with the mention of the two symbolical trigrams, it is made, for the sake of the symmetry, to form a part of the [treatise on the Symbolism](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/xiang-zhuan) of the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/yi-jing).

I will give a few examples of the paragraphs of the [Great Symbolism](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/xiang-zhuan). The first hexagram <font size="10">䷀</font> is formed by a repetition of the trigram <font size="5">☰</font> `Qián`([乾](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=乾)) representing heaven, and it is said on it: -- '*Heaven in its motion (gives) the idea of strength. The superior man, in accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity.*'

The second hexagram <font size="10">䷁</font> is formed by a repetition of the trigram <font size="5">☷</font>`Kūn`([坤](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=坤)) representing the earth, and it is said on it: -- '*The capacious receptivity of the earth is what is denoted by Kūn. The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue, supports men and things.*'

The [forty-fourth hexagram](e5a7a4gou.md), called <font size="10">䷫</font>`Gòu`([姤](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=姤)), is formed by the trigrams <font size="5">☴</font>`Xùn`([巽](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=巽)), representing wind, and <font size="5">☰</font>`Qián`([乾](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=乾)) representing heaven or the sky, and it is said on it: -- '*(The symbol of) wind, beneath that of the sky, forms Gòu. In accordance with this, the sovereign distributes his charges, and promulgates his announcements throughout the four quarters (of the kingdom).*'

The [fifty-ninth hexagram](e6b6a3huan.md), called <font size="10">䷺</font>`Huàn`([涣](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=涣)) is formed by the trigrams <font size="5">☵</font>`Kǎn`([坎](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=坎)), representing water, and <font size="5">☴</font>`Xùn`([巽](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=巽)), representing wind, and it is said on it: -- '*(The symbol of) water and (that of wind) above it form Huàn. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, presented offerings to God, and established the ancestral temple.*' The union of the two trigrams suggested to [king Wén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou) the idea of dissipation in the alienation of men from the Supreme Power, and of the minds of parents from their children; a condition which the wisdom of the ancient kings saw could best be met by the influences of religion.

One more example. The [twenty-sixth hexagram](e5a4a7e89384daxu.md), called <font size="10">䷙</font>`Dà Xù`([大畜](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=大畜)), is formed of the trigrams <font size="5">☰</font>`Qián`([乾](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=乾)), representing heaven or the sky, and <font size="5">☶</font>`Gèn`([艮](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=艮)), representing a mountain, and it is said on it: -- '*(The symbol of) heaven in the midst of a mountain forms Dà Xù. The superior man, in accordance with this, stores largely in his memory the words of former men and their conduct, to subserve the accumulation of his virtue.*' We are ready to exclaim and ask, 'Heaven, the sky, in the midst of a mountain! Can there be such a thing?' and [Zhū Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Xi) will tell us in reply, '*No, there cannot be such a thing in reality; but you can conceive it for the purpose of the symbolism.*'

From this and the other examples adduced from [the Great Symbolism](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/xiang-zhuan), it is clear that, so far as its testimony bears on the subject, [the trigrams](Bagua-name-earlier.svg) of [Fú Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi) did not receive their form and meaning with a deep intention that they should serve as the basis of a philosophical scheme concerning the constitution of heaven and earth and all that is in them. In this Appendix they are used popularly, just as one

'Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.'

The writer moralises from them in an edifying manner. There is ingenuity, and sometimes instruction also, in what he says, but there is no mystery. Chinese scholars and gentlemen, however, who have got some little acquaintance with western science, are fond of saying that all the truths of electricity, heat, light, and other branches of European physics, are in the eight trigrams. When asked how then they and their countrymen have been and are ignorant of those truths, they say that they have to learn them first from western books, and then, looking into the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/yi-jing), they see that they were all known to Confucius more than 2000, years ago. The vain assumption thus manifested is childish; and until the Chinese drop their hallucination about the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/yi-jing) as containing all things that have ever been dreamt of in all philosophies, it will prove a stumbling-block to them, and keep them from entering on the true path of science.
