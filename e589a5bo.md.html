<p><strong>Bō ䷖</strong> is the symbol of falling or of causing to fall, and may be applied, both in the natural and political world, to the process of decay, or that of overthrow. The figure consists of five divided lines, and one undivided, which last thus becomes the prominent and principal line in the figure. Decay or overthrow has begun at the bottom of it, and crept up to the top. The hexagram is that of the ninth month, when the beauty and glory of summer have disappeared, and the year is ready to fall into the arms of sterile winter. In the political world, small men have gradually displaced good men and great, till but one remains; and the lesson for him is to wait. The power operating against him is <sub><a href="e5a48dfu.md#p-107">p. 107</a></sub> too strong; but the fashion of political life passes away. If he wait, a change for the better will shortly appear.</p>
<p>The lesser symbolism is chiefly that of a bed or couch with its occupant. The idea of the hexagram requires this occupant to be overthrown, or at least that an attempt be made to overthrow him. Accordingly the attempt in line 1 is made by commencing with the legs of the couch. The symbolism goes on to explain itself. The object of the evil worker is the overthrow of all firm correctness. of course there will be evil.</p>
<p>Line 2 is to the same effect as 1; only the foe has advanced from the legs to the frame of the couch.</p>
<p>Line 3 also represents an overthrower; but it differs from the others in being the correlate of 6. The subject of it will take part with him. His association is with the subject of 6, and not, as in the other weak lines, with one of its own kind.</p>
<p>From line 4 the danger is imminent. The couch has been overthrown. The person of the occupant is at the mercy of the destroyers.</p>
<p>With line 5 the symbolism changes. The subject of 5 is 'lord of all the other weak lines,' and their subjects are at his disposal. He and they are represented as fishes, following one another as if strung together. All fishes come under the category of <code>yīn</code>. Then the symbolism changes again. The subject of 5, representing and controlling all the <code>yīn</code> lines, is loyal to the subject of the <code>yáng</code> sixth line. He is the rightful sovereign in his palace, and 5 leads all the others there to enjoy the sovereign's favours.</p>
<p>We have still different symbolism under line 6. Its strong subject, notwithstanding the attempts against him, survives, and acquires fresh vigour. The people again cherish their sovereign, and the plotters have wrought to their own overthrow.</p>
