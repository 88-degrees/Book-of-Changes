<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The trigram <strong>Kǎn ䷜</strong>, which is doubled to form this hexagram, is the lineal symbol of water. Its meaning, as a character, is 'a pit,' 'a perilous cavity, or defile;'
and here and elsewhere in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching"><strong>Yì</strong></a> it leads the reader to think of a dangerous defile, with water flowing through it.
It becomes symbolic of danger, and what the authors of the Text had in mind was to show how danger should be encountered, its effect on the mind, and how to get out of it.</p>
<p>The trigram exhibits a strong central line, between two divided lines. The central represented to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou">king Wén</a> the sincere honesty and goodness of the subject of the hexagram, whose mind was sharpened and made penetrating by contact with danger, and who p. 120 acted in a manner worthy of his character. It is implied, though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Wings"><strong>Tuàn</strong></a> does not say it, that he would get out of the danger,</p>
<p>Line 1 is weak, at the bottom of the figure, and has no correlate above, no helper, that is, beyond itself. All these things render the case of its subject hopeless. He will by his efforts only involve himself more deeply in danger.</p>
<p>Line 2 is strong, and in the centre. Its subject is unable, indeed, to escape altogether from the danger, but he does not involve himself more deeply in it like the subject of 1, and obtains some ease.</p>
<p>Line 3 is weak, and occupies the place of a strong line. Its subject is in an evil case.</p>
<p>Line 4 is weak, and will get no help from its correlate in 1. Its subject is not one who can avert the danger threatening himself and others. But his position is close to that of the ruler in 5, whose intimacy he cultivates with an unostentatious sincerity, symbolled by the appointments of the simple feast, and whose intelligence he cautiously enlightens. In consequence, there will be no error.</p>
<p>The subject of line 5 is on the eve of extrication and deliverance. The waters of the defile will ere long have free vent and disappear, and the ground will be levelled and made smooth. The line is strong, in a proper place, and in the place of honour.</p>
<p>The case of the subject of line 6 is hopeless. When danger has reached its highest point, there he is, represented by a weak line, and with no proper correlate below. The 'thicket of thorns' is taken as a metaphor for a prison; but if the expression has a history, I have been unable to find it.</p>
