<p><strong>Yì ䷩</strong> indicates that (in the state which it denotes) there will be advantage in every movement which shall be undertaken, that it will be advantageous (even) to cross the great stream.</p>
<p>1.<a name="42.1"></a> The first <code>NINE</code>, undivided, shows that it will be advantageous for its subject in his position to make a great movement. If it be greatly fortunate, no blame will be imputed to him.</p>

Let him persevere in being firm and correct, and there will be good fortune. Let the king, (having the virtues thus distinguished), employ them in presenting his offerings to God, and there will be good fortune.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Yì ䷩</strong> has the opposite meaning to <a href="e68d9fsun.md"><strong>Sǔn ䷨</strong></a>, and is the symbol of addition or increasing.
What <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou">king Wén</a> had in his mind, in connexion with the hexagram, was a ruler or a government operating <sub><a href="e5a4acguai.md#p-151">p. 151</a></sub> so as to dispense benefits to,
and increase the resources of all the people. Two indications are evident in the lines; -- the strong line in the ruler's seat, or the fifth line, and the weak line in the correlative place of 2. Whether there be other indications in the figure or its component trigrams will be considered in dealing with the Appendixes. The writer might well say, on general grounds,
of the ruler whom he had in mind, that he would be successful in his enterprises and overcome the greatest difficulties.</p>
<p>Line 1 is strong, but its low position might seem to debar its subject from any great enterprise.
Favoured as he is, however, according to the general idea of the hexagram,
and specially responding to the proper correlate in 4, it is natural that he should make a movement; and great success will make his rashness be forgotten.</p>
<p>With paragraph 2 compare paragraph 5 of the preceding hexagram. Line 2 is weak, but in the centre, and is the correlate of 5. Friends give its subject the valuable gifts mentioned; 'that is,' says <a href="https://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&author=郭雍&remap=gb">Guō Yōng</a> (Sòng dynasty), 'men benefit him; the oracles of the divination are in his favour, -- spirits, that is, benefit him; and finally, when the king sacrifices to God, He accepts. Heaven confers benefit from above.'</p>
<p>Line 3 is weak, neither central, nor in its correct position. It would seem therefore that its subject should have no increase given to him.
But it is the time for giving increase, and the idea of his receiving it by means of evil things is put into the line.
That such things serve for reproof and correction is well known to Chinese moralists. But the paragraph goes on also to caution and admonish.</p>
<p>Line 4 is the place for a minister, near to that of the ruler. Its subject is weak, but his place is appropriate, and as he follows the <sub><a href="e5a4acguai.md#p-152">p. 152</a></sub> due course, his ruler will listen to him, and he will be a support in the most critical movements. Changing the capital from place to place was frequent in the feudal times of China. That of Shang, which preceded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty">Zhōu</a>, was changed five times.</p>
<p>Line 5 is strong, in its fitting position, and central. It is the seat of the ruler, who has his proper correlate in 2. Everything good, according to the conditions of the hexagram, therefore, may be said of him; -- as is done.</p>
<p>Line 6 is also strong; but it should be weak. Occupying the topmost place of the figure, its subject will concentrate his powers in the increase of himself, and not think of benefiting those below him; and the consequence will be as described.</p>
