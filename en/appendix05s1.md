[Treatise of Remarks on the Trigrams](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/shuo-gua)

Chapter <a id="fr_286"/>[I](#fn_286). 

1. Anciently, when the sages made the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes), in order to give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences, they produced (the rules for the use of) the divining plant.

2. The number 3 was assigned to heaven, 2 to earth, and from these came the (other) numbers.

3. They contemplated the changes in the divided and undivided lines (by the process of manipulating the stalks), and formed the trigrams; from the movements that took place in the strong and weak lines, they produced (their teaching about) the separate lines. There ensued a harmonious conformity to the course (of duty) and to virtue, with a discrimination of what was right (in each particular case). They (thus) made an exhaustive discrimination of what was right, and effected the complete development of (every) nature, till they arrived (in the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes)) at what was appointed for it (by Heaven).

4. Anciently, when the sages made the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes), it was with the design that (its figures) should be in conformity with the principles underlying the natures (of men and things), and the ordinances (for them) appointed (by Heaven). With this view they exhibited (in them) the way of heaven, calling (the lines) `yīn` and `yáng`; the way of earth, calling (them) the weak (or soft) and the strong (or hard); and the way of men, under the names of benevolence and righteousness. Each (trigram) embraced (those) three Powers; and, being repeated, its full form consisted of six lines. A distinction was made of (the places assigned) to the `yīn` and `yáng` lines, which were variously occupied, now by the strong and now by the weak forms, and thus the figure (of each hexagram) was completed.

Chapter <a id="fr_288"/>[III](#fn_288).

5. (The symbols of) heaven and earth received their determinate positions; (those for) mountains and collections of water interchanged their influences; (those for) thunder and wind excited each other the more; and (those for) water and fire did each other no harm. (Then) among these eight symbols there was a mutual communication.

6. The numbering of the past is a natural process.; the knowledge of the coming is anticipation. Therefore in the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes) we have (both) anticipation (and the natural process).

7. [Thunder serves to put things in motion](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes/shuo-gua#n81917); wind to scatter (the genial seeds of) them; rain to moisten them; the sun to warm them; (what is symbolised by) **☶ Gèn**, to `arrest (and keep them in their places)`; (by) **☱ Duì**, to `give them joyful course`; (by) **☰ Qián**, to `rule them`; and by **☷ Kūn**, to `store them up`.

Chapter <a id="fr_290"/>[V](#fn_290).

8. *God comes forth* in **☳ Zhèn** (*to His producing work*); *He brings (His processes) into full and equal action* in **☴ Xùn**; *they are manifested to one another in* **☲ Lí**; *the greatest service is done for Him* in **☷ Kūn**; *He rejoices in* **☱ Duì**; *He struggles* in **☰ Qián**; *He is comforted and enters into rest* in **☵ Kǎn**; and *He completes (the work of the year)* in **☶ Gèn**.

<a id="p-426"/>

9. *All things are made to issue forth* in **☳ Zhèn**, *which is placed at `the east`.* *(The processes of production) are brought into full and equal action* in **☴ Xùn**, *which is placed at the `south-east`*. The being brought into full and equal action refers to the purity and equal arrangement of all things. **☲ Lí** *gives the idea of brightness. All things are now made manifest to one another. It is the trigram of the south.* The sages turn their faces to the south when they give audience to all under the sky, administering government towards the region of brightness: -- the idea in this procedure was taken from this. **☷ Kūn** *denotes the earth, (and is placed at the south-west)*. All things receive from it their fullest nourishment, and hence it is said, '*The greatest service is done for Him* in **☷ Kūn**.' **☱ Duì** *corresponds (to the west) and to the autumn, -- the season in which all things rejoice.* Hence it is said, 'He rejoices in **Duì ☱**.' He struggles in **☰ Qián**, *which is the trigram of the north-west.* The idea is that there the inactive and active conditions beat against each other. **☵ Kǎn** *denotes water. It is the trigram of the exact north, -- the trigram of comfort and rest, what all things are tending to.* Hence it is said, '*He is comforted and enters into rest * in **☵ Kǎn**. **☳ Zhèn** *is the trigram of the north-east. In it all things bring to a full end the issues of the past (year), and prepare the commencement of the next.* Hence it is said, '*He completes (the work of the year)* in **☶ Gèn**.'

Chapter <a id="fr_291"/>[VI](#fn_291).

10. When we speak of Spirit we mean the subtle (presence and operation of God) with all things. For putting all things in motion there is nothing more vehement than thunder; for scattering them there is nothing more effective than wind; for drying them up there is nothing more parching than fire; for giving them pleasure and satisfaction there is nothing more grateful than a lake or marsh; for moistening them there is nothing more enriching than water; for bringing them to an end and making them begin again there is nothing more fully adapted than **☵ Kǎn**. *Thus water and fire contribute together to the one object; thunder and wind do not act contrary to each other; mountains and collections of water interchange their influences. It is in this way, that they are able to change and transform, and to give completion to all things.*

11. **☰ Qián** is (the symbol of) `strength`; **☷ Kūn**, of `docility`; **☳ Zhèn**, of `stimulus to movement`; **☴ Xùn**, of `penetration`; **☵ Kǎn**, of what is `precipitous` and `perilous`; **☲ Lí**, of what is `bright` and what is `catching`; **☶ Gèn**, of `stoppage` or `arrest`; and **☱ Duì**, of `pleasure` and `satisfaction`.

<a id="p-429"/>

Chapter <a id="fr_293"/>[VIII](#fn_293).

12. **☰ Qián** (suggests the idea of) a `horse`; **☷ Kūn**, that of an `ox`; **☳ Zhèn**, that of the `dragon`; **☴ Xùn**, that of a `fowl`; **☵ Kǎn**, that of a `pig`; **☲ Lí**, that of a `pheasant`; **☶ Gèn**, that of a `dog`; and **☱ Duì**, that of a `sheep`.

Chapter <a id="fr_294"/>[IX](#fn_294).

Chapter <a id="fr_295"/>[X](#fn_295). 

14. **☰ Qián** is (the symbol of) `heaven`, and hence has the appellation of `father`. **☷ Kūn** is (the symbol of) `earth`, and hence has the appellation of `mother`, **☳ Zhèn** shows a first application (of **☷ Kūn** to **☰ Qián**), resulting in getting (the first of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called `the oldest son`. **☴ Xùn** shows a first application (of **☰ Qián** to **☷ Kūn**), resulting in getting (the first of) its female (or divided lines), and hence is called `the oldest daughter`. **☵ Kǎn** shows a second application (of **☷ Kūn** to **☰ Qián**), resulting in getting (the second of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called `the second son`. **☲ Lí** shows a second application (of **☰ Qián** to **☷ Kūn**), resulting in getting the second of its female (or divided lines), and hence is called `the second daughter`. **☶ Gèn** shows a third application (of **☷ Kūn** to **☰ Qián**), resulting in getting (the third of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called `the youngest son`. **☱ Duì** shows a third application (of **☰ Qián** to **☷ Kūn**), resulting in getting (the third of) its female (or divided lines), and hence is called `the youngest daughter`.

<a id="p-430"/>

Chapter <a id="fr_296"/>[XI](#fn_296).

15. **☰ Qián** suggests the idea of `heaven`; of a `circle`; of a `ruler`; of a `father`; of `jade`; of `metal`; of `cold`; of `ice`; of `deep red`; of a `good horse`; of an `old horse`; of a `thin horse`; of a `piebald horse`; and of the `fruit of trees`.

16. **☷ Kūn** suggests the idea of the `earth`; of a `mother`; of `cloth`; of a `caldron`; of `parsimony`; of a `turning lathe`; of a `young heifer`; of a `large waggon`; of what is `variegated`; of a `multitude`; and of a `handle` and `support`. Among, soils it denotes `what is black`.

17. **☳ Zhèn** suggests the idea of `thunder`; of the `dragon`; of (the union of) the `azure` and the `yellow`; of `development`; of a `great highway`; of the `eldest son`; of `decision` and `vehemence`; of bright young `bamboos`; of `sedges` and `rushes`; among `horses`, of the `good neighed`; of one whose `white hind-leg` appears, of the `prancer`, and of one with a `white star` in his forehead. Among the `productions` of `husbandry` it suggests the idea of what returns to life from its disappearance (beneath the surface), of what in the end becomes the `strongest`, and of what is the most `luxuriant`.

<a id="p-431"/>

18. **☴ Xùn** suggests the idea of `wood`; of `wind`; of the `oldest daughter`; of a `plumb-line`; of a `carpenter's square`; of `being white`; of `being long`; of `being lofty`; of `advancing` and `receding`; of `want of decision`; and of `strong scents`. It suggests in the `human body`, the idea of `deficiency of hair`; of a `wide forehead`; of a large development of the white of the eye. (Among `tendencies`), it suggests the `close pursuit of gain`, even to making three hundred per cent in the market. In the end it may become the `trigram of decision`.

19. **☵ Kǎn** suggests the idea of `water`; of `channels` and `ditches` (for `draining` and `irrigation`); of `being hidden` and `lying concealed`; of being now `straight`, and now `crooked`; of a `bow`, and of a `wheel`. As referred to man, it suggests the idea of an` increase of anxiety`; of `distress of mind`; of `pain in the ears`; -- it is the `trigram of the blood`; it suggests the idea of `what is red`. As referred to horses, it suggests the idea of the horse with an `elegant spine`; of one with a `high spirit`; of one with a `drooping head`; of one with a `thin hoof`; and of one with a `shambling step`. As referred to `carriages`, it suggests one that `encounters many risks`. It suggests `what goes right through`; the `moon`; a `thief`. Referred to trees, it suggests that `which is strong`, and `firm-hearted`.

<a id="p-432"/>

20. **☲ Lí** suggests the emblem of `fire`; of the `sun`; of `lightning`; of the `second daughter`; of `buff-coat` and `helmet`; of `spear` and `sword`. Referred to men, it suggests the `large belly`. It is the `trigram of dryness`. It suggests the emblem of a `turtle`; of a `crab`; of a `spiral univalve`; of the `mussel`; and of the `tortoise`. Referred to trees, it suggests one which is `hollow` and `rotten above`.

21. **☶ Gèn** suggests the emblem of a `mountain`; of a `by-path`; of a `small rock`; of a `gateway`; of the `fruits of trees` and `creeping plants`; of a `porter` or a `eunuch`; of the (ring) `finger`; of the `dog`; of the `rat`; of `birds` with `powerful bills`; among trees, of those `which are strong`, with many `joints`.

22. **☱ Duì** suggests the emblem of a `low-lying collection of water`; of the `youngest daughter`; of a `sorceress`; of the `mouth` and `tongue`; of the `decay` and `putting down` (of `things in harvest`); of the `removal` (of fruits) hanging (from the stems or branches); among soils, of `what is strong and salt`; of a `concubine`; and of a `sheep`.

## Footnotes

<a id="fn_286"/>[422:I](#fr_286) Chapter I, paragraphs 1-3, treats of the rise of the scheme of the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes) from the wonderful qualities of the divining plant, the use of certain numbers, and the formation of the lineal figures.

P. Regis translates paragraph 1 by -- 'The ancient (sages), the most excellent men, were the authors of the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes), in making which they were assisted by an intelligent spirit, who for their help produced the plant called `Shī`([蓍](shi.jpg)).'

But the text will not admit of this version, nor have I found the view given in it in any Chinese writer. It is difficult to make up one's mind whether to translate -- `the sage`, or `the sages`. [Kǒng Yǐng Dá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Yingda) contends that the writer had [Fú Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi) and him [alone in his mind](#p-423). To me it seems otherwise. [Fú Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi), if we accept the testimony of universal Chinese consent, made the eight trigrams; but he did not make the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes), which, by the same consent, was the production of king [Wén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou) and his son.

The text would seem to say that the sages `produced` the plant, but this is so extravagant that the view indicated in my supplementary clause appears in all the best commentators. So understood, the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes) may be said to '*give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences*,' or, if we take that name as singular (according to the analogy of [chapter 6](#fr_291)), to the Divine Being in affording a revelation of His will, as in paragraph 3. We may well say that it is a pity the revelation should be so enigmatical; but the author, it must be remembered, is writing from his own standpoint. [Wén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou) and his son, as I have endeavoured to show in the Introduction, merely wished to convey, under the style and veil of divination, their moral and political lessons.

On paragraph 2 it is said that heaven is round; and as the circumference of a circle is three times its diameter, hence `3` is the number of heaven. Again, earth is square, and as the circumference of a square is four times its length or breadth, or it consists of two pairs of equal sides, hence `2` is the number of earth.

The concluding statement about Chapter I the other numbers' is understood of the [manipulation of the divining stalks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination), as in [Appendix III, i, 51](appendix03s1.md#p-365). That manipulation, thrice repeated, might leave three stalks each time, and `3 x 3 = 9`; or `2`, being in the same way in `all = 6`; or `twice 3` and `once 2 = 8`; or `twice 2` and `once 3 = 7`. These are the numbers of the 4 binary symbols, employed in forming the new figures; <font size="5">⚌</font>, the `old yáng`, `= 9`; <font size="5">⚍</font>, the `young yīn`, `= 8`; <font size="5">⚎</font>, the `young yáng`, `= 7`; and <font size="5">⚏</font>, the `old yīn`, `= 6`.

| Number | Yarrow stalks probability | Three coins probability | Yīn / Yáng   | Signification | Line |
|---|--------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------|----------|
|     6 | 1/16                     | 2/16                    | old yīn        | yīn changing to yáng | ---x--- |
|     7 | 5/16  (yáng 8/16)  | 6/16  (yáng 8/16) | young yáng | yáng unchanging      | ------- |
|     8 | 7/16   (yīn 8/16)    | 6/16   (yīn 8/16)  | young yīn    | yīn unchanging         | --- --- |
|     9 | 3/16                      | 2/16                   | old yáng     | yáng changing to yīn  | ---o--- |

<a id="fn_287"/>[424:II](#fr_287) Chapter II. The top line in each trigram thus belongs to the category of `heaven`; the bottom line to that of `earth`; and the middle line to that of `man`. The `odd places` should be occupied, `1 correctly`, by the undivided lines; and the `even` by the divided. The trigram being increased to the hexagram, lines `5` and `6` were assigned to `heaven`; `1` and `2` to `earth`; and `3` and `4` to `man`. `5` is the `yáng` characteristic of `heaven`, and `6` the `yīn`; so 1 and 2 in regard to `earth`; while `3` represents the benevolence of `man`, and `4` his `righteousness`. But all this is merely the play of fancy, and confuses the mind of the student.

<a id="fn_288"/>[424:III](#fr_288) Chapter III, paragraphs 5 and 6, is understood, though not very clearly, by referring to the circular arrangement of the trigrams according to [Fú Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi), as shown in [Figure II](Bagua-name-earlier.svg). Paragraph 5 refers to the correlation of **☰ Qián** and **☷ Kūn**, **☶ Gèn** and **☱ Duì**, **☳ Zhèn** and **☴ Xùn**, **☵ Kǎn** and **☲ Lí**. Paragraph 6 is less easy of apprehension. Starting in the same figure from **☰ Qián** and numbering on the left we come to **☳ Zhèn** by a natural process. Then [we turn back](#p-425), and numbering on the right, from **☴ Xùn**, we come by a backward process to **☷ Kūn**. The same process is illustrated on a large scale by the circular arrangement of the 64 hexagrams in [Plate I](fuxi_arrangement.png) and [Plate II](wen_arrangement.png). But what the scope of the paragraph is I cannot tell, and am tempted to say of it, as P. Regis does, '*This observation is totally pointless.*'

<a id="fn_289"/>[425:IV](#fr_289) In chapter IV we have the same circular arrangement of the trigrams, though they are named in a different order; the last first and the first last. The first four are mentioned by their elemental names; the last four by the names of their lineal figures. No special significance is attached to this. If it ever had any, it has been lost.

<a id="fn_290"/>[426:V](#fr_290) Chapter V, paragraphs 8 and 9, sets forth the operations of nature in the various seasons, as being really the operations of God, who is named `Dì`([帝](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帝)), 'the Lord and Ruler of Heaven.' Those operations are represented in the progress by the seasons of the year, as denoted by the trigrams, according to the arrangement of them by king [Wén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou), as shown also in [Figure I](later_heaven.jpg).

'The greatest service is done for `Dì`([帝](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帝)) in **☷ Kūn**;' [Yáng Wàn Lǐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Wanli) (of our twelfth century, but earlier than [Zhū Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Xi)) says: -- '**Kūn ☷** is a minister or servant. [**Dì**](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/帝) is his ruler, All that a ruler has to do with his minister is to require his service.' 'On the struggles in **☰ Qián**' he says: -- '**☰ Qián** is the trigram of the north-west, when the `yīn` influence is growing strong and the `yáng` diminishing.'

The `purity` predicated in paragraph 9 of things in **☴ Xùn**, was explained by [Zhèng Xuán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Xuan) (郑玄) (our second century) [as equivalent to 'newness,'](#fr_290) referring to the brightness of all things in the light of spring and summer. On 'all things receive from the earth their fullest nourishment' the same `Yáng`(阳), quoted above, says: -- '*The earth performs the part of a mother, All things are its children. What a mother has to do for her children is simply to nourish them.*'

<a id="fn_291"/>[427:VI](#fr_291) Chapter VI is the sequel of the preceding. There ought to have been some mention of [Shén](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/神#Chinese) or, `Spirit` in chapter 5. It is the first character in this chapter, and the two characters that follow show that it is here resumed for the purpose of being explained. As it does not occur in chapter 5, we must suppose that the author of it here brings forward and explains the idea of it that was in his mind. Many of the commentators recognise this, -- e.g. [Liáng Yín](https://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=en&res=52419) (梁寅), as quoted in the [Introduction](appendix08s1.md#p-33).

Two other peculiarities in the style of the chapter are pointed out and explained (after a fashion) by [Cuī Jǐng](https://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&file=60350&page=90) (崔憬) (earlier, probably, than the Sòng dynasty): -- 'The action of six of the trigrams is described, but no mention is made of **☰ Qián** or **☷ Kūn**. But [heaven and earth do nothing](#fr_291), and yet do everything; hence they are able to perfect the spirit-like subtilty of the action of thunder, wind, and the other things. (Moreover), we have the trigram **☶ Gèn** mentioned, the only one mentioned by its name, instead of our reading "mountains," The reason is, that the putting in motion, the scattering, the parching, and the moistening, are all the palpable effects of thunder, wind, fire, and water. But what is ascribed to **☶ Gèn**, the ending and the recommencing all things, is not so evident of mountains. On this account the name of the trigram is given, while the things in nature represented by the trigrams are given in those other cases. The style suitable in each case is employed.'

<a id="fn_292"/>[428:VII](#fr_292) Chapter VII mentions the attributes, called also the `virtues`, of the different trigrams. It is not easy to account for the qualities -- 'their nature and feelings' -- ascribed to them. [Kǒng Yǐng Dá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Yingda) (孔颖达) says: -- '**☰ Qián** is represented by heaven, which revolves without ceasing, and so it is the symbol of strength; **☷ Kūn** by the earth, which receives docilely the action of heaven, and so it is the symbol of docility; **☳ Zhèn** by thunder, which excites and moves all things, and so it is the symbol of what produces movement; **☴ Xùn** by Wind, which enters everywhere, and so it is the symbol of penetration; **☵ Kǎn** by water, found in a place perilous and precipitous, and the name is explained accordingly; **☲ Lí** by fire, and fire is sure to lay hold of things, and so it is the symbol of being attached to; **☶ Gèn** by a mountain, the mass of which is still and arrests progress, and so it is the symbol of stoppage or arrest; and **☱ Duì** by a lake or marsh, which moistens all things, and so it is the symbol of satisfaction.'

The [Kāng Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Dictionary) editors consider this explanation of the qualities of the trigrams to be unsatisfactory, and certainly it has all the appearance of an expost fact account. They prefer the views of the philosopher [Shào Yōng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shao_Yong) (邵雍) (of our eleventh century), which is based on the arrangement of the undivided and divided lines in the figures. This to me is more unsatisfactory than the other. The [editors say](#fr_292), moreover, that [Shào](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shao_Yong)'s account of the three `yáng` trigrams, **☳ Zhèn**, **☵ Kǎn**, and **☶ Gèn** is correct, and that of the three `yīn`, **☴ Xùn**, **☲ Lí**, and **☱ Duì** incorrect; but this would be based on king [Wén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou)'s arrangement, which does not appear to have place here.

<a id="fn_293"/>[429:VIII](#fr_293) Chapter VIII. In the [Great Appendix, Section II](appendix03s2.md#fr_267), it is said that [Fú Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi), in making his trigrams, was guided by '*the consideration of things apart from his own person.*' Of such things we have a specimen here. The creatures are assigned, in their classes, to the different trigrams, symbolising the ideas in the last chapter. We must not make any difference of sex in translating their names.

<a id="fn_294"/>[429:IX](#fr_294) Chapter IX. [Fú Xī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi) found also '*things near at hand, in his own person,*' while making the trigrams. We have here a specimen of such things.

<a id="fn_295"/>[430:X](#fr_295) Chapter X has been discussed in the Introduction. Let it simply be added here, that the account which it does give of the formation of the six subsidiary trigrams is inconsistent with their gradual rise from the mutual imposition of the undivided and divided lines.

<a id="fn_296"/>[432:XI](#fr_296) Chapter XI may be made to comprehend all the paragraphs from the 15th to the end, and shows how universally the ideas underlying the [Yì Jīng](https://ctext.org/book-of-changes) are diffused through the world of nature. The quality of the several trigrams will be found with more or less of truth, and with less or more of fancy, in the objects mentioned in connexion with them. More needs not to be said on the chapter than has been done in the Introduction.
