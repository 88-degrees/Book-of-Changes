## Jīng Shì Yì Zhuàn (京氏易传)

"[Master Jing's commentary and transmission of the Book of Changes](https://ctext.org/jingshi-yizhuan)" is a commentary on and alternative version of the Confucian Classic Yijing (易经) "[Book of Changes](../README.md)" written by the Han-period 汉 (206 BCE-220 CE) Confucian scholar [Jīng Fáng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing_Fang) 京房 (77-37 BCE). He was a disciple of [Jiāo Yán Shòu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/焦贛) 焦延寿 (also Called Jiāo Gàn 焦赣) and left the capital because he had some arguments with a high official, [Shí Xiǎn](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/石顯) 石显. He became governor ([Tài Shǒu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/太守) 太守) of the commandery of [Wèi Jùn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Commandery) 魏郡 and was later executed for political reasons.

[Jīng Fáng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing_Fang) saw the [Yì Jīng](../README.md) not as a philosophical book, but in its original sense as a book on divination. He extended the teachings of [Jiāo Yán Shòu](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/焦贛) about the "trigrams of the eight palaces" (bā gōng guà 八宫卦), the "adaption of the cyclical sign jia" (nà jiǎ 納甲), the Five Agents (wǔ xīng 五行), and the energy of the hexagrams (guà qì 卦气). Some ideas explained by [Jīng Fáng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing_Fang) came from his teachers [Duàn Jiā](#) 段嘉, [Yáo Píng](https://baike.baidu.com/item/姚平/57064) 姚平 or [Chéng Hóng](#) 乘弘. On the other hand, the 3-[Juàn](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&char=卷)-long [Jīng Shì Yì Zhuàn](https://ctext.org/jingshi-yizhuan) was the base for many later divination methods, like pointing at the relation of hexagrams and the world (`shì yìng`世应), hidden and open manifestations of change (`fēi fú`飞伏), the arrangement of the six hexagram lines (`liù wèi`六位), combinations of hexagrams with the ten celestial stems (`shí jiǎ`十甲), the five stars (`wǔ xīng`五星) influencing human life, the four energies (`sì qì`四气) in the human body producing fluids or controlling the organs, the six closer family relationships (`liù qīn`六亲), and the nine kinsbonds (`jiù zú`九族), the "palace of fortune and virtue" (`fú dé`福德), and mutual displacement (`xíng`刑).

In spite of its name, the [Yì Zhuàn](https://ctext.org/jingshi-yizhuan) is not really a commentary (zhuàn 传) on the oracle book [Yì Jīng](../README.md), but an explanation of a similar, but different system of hexagrams, meaning, a different tradition (chuán 传). The names of the hexagrams are identical to the [Yì Jīng](../README.md), but the arrangement is different. They are grouped to eight series of "palace hexagrams" (gōng bā guà 宫八卦), in which the head hexagrams changes seven times and so display the relation between hexagram lines and the state (shì yìng 世应 "correspondence to the world"), visible and hidden relations between hexagrams and their lines (fēi fú 飞伏 "flying and crouching"), changes to other hexagrams by the transformation of one line (yóu hún 游魂 "wandering spirits") and the return to the original hexagram (guī hún 归魂 "returning spirits") etc. on the transformation of all circumstances under Heaven, including politics and personal life.

The last juan of the Yizhuan explains the invention of the divination of changes by using milfoil stalks, the method of combining hexagrams with the Celestial Stems (`nà jiǎ fǎ`纳甲法), the combination of hexagrams with the twenty-four calendric terms (`èr shí sì qì hòu`二十四气候), the change concering Heaven, Earth, and the world of humans and ghosts, and the meaning of hexagrams lines for relatives, spouses, fortune and office, the appearance of auspicious dragons and inauspicious tigers in hexagram lines, and the correlation to the Five Agents 五行 and their mutual production and extinction. The more modern method of divination by a coin (`qián bǔ`钱卜) also originates in these descriptions, as well as a divination method called "fire pearls" (`huǒ zhū lín`火珠林) that was described by [Xiàng Ān Shì](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/项安世) 項安世.
